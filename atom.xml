They listen and solicit views but do not default to consensus-driven decision making. &#x201C;Consensus is good, but it&#x2019;s too slow, and sometimes you end up with the lowest common denominator,&#x201D; says Christophe Weber, CEO of Takeda Pharmaceutical. Weber makes a habit of having unstructured meetings with 20 to 30 of the company&#x2019;s high potentials before making key decisions. The goal of those meetings is to challenge him and present him with new perspectives, but he is careful not to create the illusion of democracy.</p><p>None of this means that CEOs should behave as autocrats or lone wolves. Typically we see &#x201C;take no prisoners&#x201D; CEOs last only as long as the company has no choice but to submit to shock therapy. These CEOs often get ousted as soon as the business emerges from crisis mode&#x2014;they lose the support of their teams or of board members who&#x2019;ve grown tired of the collateral damage. It&#x2019;s no coincidence that the careers of turnaround CEOs are frequently a series of lucrative two- to three-year stints; they put out the fires and then move on to the next assignment.</p><h3 id="3-Adapting-proactively"><a href="#3-Adapting-proactively" class="headerlink" title="3. Adapting proactively."></a>3. Adapting proactively.</h3><p>For evidence of how important it is for businesses and leaders to adjust to a rapidly changing environment, we need look no further than the aftermath of Brexit and the recent U.S. presidential election. Our analysis shows that CEOs who excel at adapting are 6.7 times more likely to succeed. CEOs themselves told us over and over that this skill was critical. When asked what differentiates effective CEOs, Dominic Barton, global managing partner of McKinsey &amp; Company, immediately offered: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s dealing with situations that are not in the playbook. As a CEO you are constantly faced with situations where a playbook simply cannot exist. You&#x2019;d better be ready to adapt.&#x201D;</p><p>Most CEOs know they have to divide their attention among short-, medium-, and long-term perspectives, but the adaptable CEOs spent significantly more of their time&#x2014;as much as 50%&#x2014;thinking about the long term. Other executives, by contrast, devoted an average of 30% of their time to long-term thinking. We believe a long-term focus helps because it makes CEOs more likely to pick up on early signals. Highly adaptable CEOs regularly plug into broad information flows: They scan wide networks and diverse sources of data, finding relevance in information that may at first seem unrelated to their businesses. As a result, they sense change earlier and make strategic moves to take advantage of it.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

Engaging for impact."></a>2. Engaging for impact.</h3><p>Once CEOs set a clear course for the business, they must <u>get <strong>buy-in</strong></u> (&#x83B7;&#x5F97;&#x652F;&#x6301;) among their employees and other stakeholders. We found that strong performers balance <u>keen insight</u> (&#x654F;&#x9510;&#x7684;&#x6D1E;&#x5BDF;&#x529B;) into their stakeholders&#x2019; priorities with an unrelenting focus on delivering business results. They start by developing an astute understanding of their stakeholders&#x2019; needs and motivations, and then get people on board by driving for performance and aligning them around the goal of value creation. In our data, CEOs who deftly engaged stakeholders with this results orientation were 75% more successful in the role.</p><p>CEOs who excel at bringing others along plan and execute disciplined communications and influencing strategies. &#x201C;With any big decision, I create a stakeholder map of the key people who need to be on board,&#x201D; explains Madeline Bell, CEO of Children&#x2019;s Hospital of Philadelphia. &#x201C;I identify the detractors and their concerns, and then I think about how I can take the energy that they might put into resistance and channel it into something positive. I make it clear to people that they&#x2019;re important to the process and they&#x2019;ll be part of a win. But at the end of the day, you have to be clear that you&#x2019;re making the call and you expect them on board.&#x201D;</p><p>When interacting with stakeholders, CEOs like Bell are acutely aware of how their moods and body language can affect the impact of their communications. Though much has been written about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15769239" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;emotional contagion,&#x201D;</a> new CEOs are often surprised by the unintended damage that can be caused by a stray word or gesture. &#x201C;Every comment and facial expression you make will be read and magnified 10 times by the organization,&#x201D; says Kaufman. &#x201C;If you grimace during someone&#x2019;s presentation because of your bad back, the person making the presentation thinks they&#x2019;ve been fired.&#x201D; Composure is a job requirement, and more than three-quarters of the strong CEO candidates in our sample demonstrated calm under pressure.</p><p>CEOs who engage stakeholders do not invest their energy in being liked or protecting their teams from painful decisions. In fact, both those behaviors are commonly seen in lower-performing CEOs. Instead, the skilled CEOs gain the support of their colleagues by instilling confidence that they will lead the team to success, even if that means making uncomfortable or unpopular moves. These CEOs do not shy away from conflict in the pursuit of business goals; in fact, in our analysis two-thirds of the CEOs who excelled at engagement were rated as strong in conflict management. The ability to handle clashing viewpoints also seems to help candidates advance to the CEO&#x2019;s office. When we analyzed leaders who&#x2019;d made it there significantly faster than average, one of the qualities that stood out was their willingness to engage in conflict.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

Deciding with speed and conviction (&#x575A;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;&#x4FE1;&#x5FF5;)."></a>1. Deciding with speed and conviction (&#x575A;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;&#x4FE1;&#x5FF5;).</h3><p>Legends about CEOs who always seem to know exactly how to steer their companies to wild success seem to <strong>abound</strong> (&#x5927;&#x91CF;&#x5B58;&#x5728;&#xFF0C;&#x6709;&#x8BB8;&#x591A;) in business. But we discovered that high-performing CEOs do <u>not necessarily</u> (&#x672A;&#x5FC5;&#xFF0C;&#x4E0D;&#x4E00;&#x5B9A;) <u><strong>stand out</strong></u> (&#x8131;&#x9896;&#x800C;&#x51FA;) for making great decisions all the time; rather, they stand out for being more decisive. They make decisions earlier, faster, and with greater conviction. They do so consistently&#x2014;even <u>amid ambiguity</u> (&#x5728;&#x6A21;&#x68F1;&#x4E24;&#x53EF;&#x7684;&#x60C5;&#x51B5;&#x4E0B;), with incomplete information, and in unfamiliar domains. In our data, people who were described as &#x201C;decisive&#x201D; were 12 times more likely to be high-performing CEOs.</p><p><strong>Good CEOs realize that a wrong decision may be better than no decision at all.</strong></p><p>Interestingly, the highest-IQ executives we coach, those who relish intellectual complexity, sometimes struggle the most with decisiveness. While the quality of their decisions is often good, because of their pursuit of the perfect answer, they can take too long to make choices or set clear priorities&#x2014;and their teams pay a high price. These smart but slow decision makers become <strong>bottlenecks</strong> (&#x74F6;&#x9888;), and their teams either grow frustrated (which can lead to the <u>attrition of valuable talent</u> (&#x4EBA;&#x624D;&#x6D41;&#x5931;)) or become <strong>overcautious</strong> (&#x8FC7;&#x5206;&#x8C28;&#x614E;&#x7684;) themselves, <strong>stalling</strong> (&#x62D6;&#x5EF6;) the entire enterprise. So it&#x2019;s no surprise that when we looked more closely at the executives who were rated poor on decisiveness, we found that only 6% received low marks because they made decisions too quickly. The vast majority&#x2014;94%&#x2014;scored low because they decided too little, too late.</p><p>High-performing CEOs understand that a wrong decision is often better than no decision at all. As former Greyhound CEO Stephen Gorman, who led the bus operator <u>through a turnaround</u> (&#x5EA6;&#x8FC7;&#x96BE;&#x5173;&#xFF0C;&#x901A;&#x8FC7;&#x8F6C;&#x6298;), told us, &#x201C;A bad decision was better than a lack of direction. Most decisions can be undone, but you have to learn to move with the right amount of speed.&#x201D;</p><p>Decisive CEOs recognize that they can&#x2019;t wait for perfect information. &#x201C;Once I have 65% certainty around the answer, I have to make a call,&#x201D; says Jerry Bowe, CEO of the private-label manufacturer Vi-Jon. But they do work actively to <strong>solicit</strong> (&#x5F81;&#x6C42;) multiple points of view and often poll a relatively small, carefully cultivated &#x201C;<u>kitchen cabinet</u> (&#x975E;&#x5B98;&#x65B9;&#x987E;&#x95EE;&#x56E2;&#xFF0C;&#x79C1;&#x4EBA;&#x987E;&#x95EE;&#x56E2;&#xFF1B;&#x53A8;&#x623F;&#x7684;&#x9910;&#x5177;&#x67DC;)&#x201D; of trusted advisers who can be <u>counted on</u> (&#x6307;&#x671B;&#xFF0C;&#x4F9D;&#x9760;) for <strong>unvarnished</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x88C5;&#x9970;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x65E0;&#x63A9;&#x9970;&#x7684;) opinions and <strong>sound</strong> (&#x5408;&#x7406;&#x7684;) judgment. </p><p>Bowe motivates himself to act on decisions by framing things this way: &#x201C;I ask myself two questions: First, what&#x2019;s the impact if I get it wrong? And second, how much will it hold other things up if I don&#x2019;t move on this?&#x201D; That approach, he says, also inspires his team members to trust their own judgment on <u>operational decisions</u> (&#x7ECF;&#x8425;&#x51B3;&#x7B56;)&#x2014;which is critical to freeing the CEO up to home in on fewer but more important decisions.</p><p><u><strong>To that end</strong></u> (&#x4E3A;&#x6B64;&#xFF0C;&#x4E3A;&#x4E86;&#x90A3;&#x4E2A;&#x76EE;&#x7684;), successful CEOs also know when not to decide. Stephen Kaufman, former CEO of Arrow Electronics, suggests that it is all too easy to <u>get caught up</u> (&#x88AB;&#x5377;&#x5165;) in a volley of decision making (&#x4EBA;&#x4EEC;&#x5F88;&#x5BB9;&#x6613;&#x9677;&#x5165;&#x4E00;&#x5927;&#x5806;&#x51B3;&#x7B56;&#x4E2D;). He advises pausing briefly to consider whether a decision should actually be made lower down in the organization and if delaying it a week or a month would allow important information to emerge without causing <strong>irreparable</strong> (&#x4E0D;&#x80FD;&#x633D;&#x56DE;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4E0D;&#x80FD;&#x4FEE;&#x8865;&#x7684;) harm.</p><p>But once a path is chosen, high-performing CEOs press ahead without <strong>wavering</strong> (&#x72B9;&#x8C6B;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4E0D;&#x7A33;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;). Art Collins, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, told us: &#x201C;Employees and other key <strong>constituencies</strong> (&#x652F;&#x6301;&#x8005;) will quickly lose faith in leaders who <strong>waffle</strong> (&#x80E1;&#x626F;&#xFF1B;&#x95F2;&#x804A;) or <strong>backtrack</strong> (&#x7531;&#x539F;&#x8DEF;&#x8FD4;&#x56DE;&#xFF1B;&#x653E;&#x5F03;) once a decision is made.&#x201D; And if decisions don&#x2019;t turn out well? Our analysis suggests that while every CEO makes mistakes, most of them are not <strong>lethal</strong> (&#x81F4;&#x547D;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x81F4;&#x6B7B;&#x7684;). We found that among CEOs who were fired over issues related to decision making, only one-third lost their jobs because they&#x2019;d made bad calls; the rest were <strong>ousted</strong> (&#x53D6;&#x4EE3;&#xFF0C;&#x8D76;&#x4E0B;&#x53F0;) for being indecisive.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

For example, our analysis revealed that while boards often <strong>gravitate</strong> (&#x88AB;&#x5438;&#x5F15;) toward charismatic extroverts, introverts are slightly more likely to surpass the expectations of their boards and investors. We were also surprised to learn that virtually all CEO candidates had made <u><strong>material mistakes</strong></u> (&#x91CD;&#x5927;&#x9519;&#x8BEF;) in the past, and 45% of them had had at least one major career <strong>blowup</strong> (&#x5D29;&#x6E83;) that ended a job or was extremely costly to the business. Yet more than 78% of that subgroup of candidates ultimately won the top job. In addition, we found that educational pedigree (or lack thereof) in no way correlated to performance: Only 7% of the high-performing CEOs we studied had an undergraduate <u><strong>Ivy League</strong></u> (&#x957F;&#x6625;&#x85E4;&#x8054;&#x76DF;) education, and 8% of them didn&#x2019;t graduate from college at all.</p><p>And when we compared the qualities that boards respond well to in candidate interviews with those that help leaders perform better, the overlap was <strong>vanishingly</strong> (&#x96BE;&#x4EE5;&#x5BDF;&#x89C9;&#x5730;&#xFF1B;&#x8D8B;&#x4E8E;&#x96F6;&#x5730;) small. For example, high confidence more than doubles a candidate&#x2019;s chances of being chosen as CEO but provides no advantage in performance on the job. In other words, what makes candidates look good to boards has little connection to what makes them succeed in the role.</p><p>But our most important discovery was that successful chief executives tend to demonstrate four specific behaviors that prove critical to their performance. We also found that when boards focus on those behaviors in their selection and development processes, they significantly increase their chances of hiring the right CEO. And our research and experience suggest that when leaders who <strong>aspire</strong> (&#x6E34;&#x671B;&#xFF1B;&#x7ACB;&#x5FD7;&#xFF1B;&#x8FFD;&#x6C42;) to the CEO&#x2019;s office&#x2014;87% of executives, according to a 2014 survey from Korn Ferry&#x2014;deliberately develop those behaviors, they dramatically raise the odds that they&#x2019;ll become high-performing chief executives.</p><h2 id="The-Four-Behaviors"><a href="#The-Four-Behaviors" class="headerlink" title="The Four Behaviors"></a>The Four Behaviors</h2><p>It&#x2019;s rare for successful leaders to excel at all four behaviors. However, when we <strong>dug</strong> (&#x6316;&#xFF0C;&#x7FFB;&#x571F;&#xFF08;dig&#x7684;&#x8FC7;&#x53BB;&#x5F0F;&#x548C;&#x8FC7;&#x53BB;&#x5206;&#x8BCD;&#xFF09;) through our data, looking at the ratings our consultants had given candidates when evaluating them on fit for a CEO job and performance on 30 management <strong>competencies</strong> (&#x80FD;&#x529B;&#xFF0C;&#x80DC;&#x4EFB;&#x7279;&#x5F81;) (for example, holding people <strong>accountable</strong> (&#x8D1F;&#x8D23;&#x4EFB;&#x7684;) and the ability to motivate a team), we found an interesting connection. Roughly half the strong candidates (who had earned an A overall on a scale of A, B, or C) had <strong>distinguished</strong> (&#x533A;&#x522B;&#xFF0C;&#x5353;&#x8D8A;&#x7684;) themselves in more than one of the four essential behaviors, while only 5% of the weak candidates (who earned a B or C) had.</p><p>The behaviors we&#x2019;re about to describe sound <strong>deceptively</strong> (&#x770B;&#x4F3C;&#xFF1B;&#x4E0D;&#x50CF;&#x770B;&#x4E0A;&#x53BB;&#x90A3;&#x4E48;&#xFF1B;&#x6BD4;&#x5B9E;&#x9645;&#x66F4;&#x663E;&#x5F97;) simple. But the key is to practice them with <strong>maniacal</strong> (&#x75AF;&#x72C2;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x72C2;&#x70ED;&#x7684;) consistency, which our work reveals is a great challenge for many leaders.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

Too many CEOs <strong>falter</strong> (&#x8870;&#x5F31;&#xFF1B;&#x8870;&#x9000;) in the job; about a quarter of the <em>Fortune</em> 500 chiefs who leave their firms each year are forced out. Clearly, boards do not always get their hires right.In conducting an analysis of in-depth assessments of 17,000 executives, the authors uncovered a large disconnect between what directors <em>think</em> makes for an ideal CEO and what <em>actually leads</em> to high performance. The findings of their 10-year research project challenge many widely held assumptions. Charisma, confidence, and pedigree all have little bearing on CEO success, it turns out. Instead, top performers demonstrate four specific business behaviors: (1) <u>They&#x2019;re <strong>decisive</strong> (&#x679C;&#x65AD;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x575A;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;), realizing they can&#x2019;t wait for perfect information and that a wrong decision is often better than no decision</u>. (2) They engage for impact, working to understand the priorities of stakeholders and then aligning them around a goal of value creation. (3) They adapt <strong>proactively</strong> (&#x524D;&#x6444;&#x5730;&#xFF1B;&#x4E3B;&#x52A8;&#x5730;), keeping an eye on the long term and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. (4) They deliver results in a reliable fashion, steadily following through on commitments (&#x4ED6;&#x4EEC;&#x4EE5;&#x53EF;&#x9760;&#x7684;&#x65B9;&#x5F0F;&#x4EA4;&#x4ED8;&#x7ED3;&#x679C;, &#x7A33;&#x6B65;&#x5C65;&#x884C;&#x627F;&#x8BFA;).</p><p><strong>The chief executive role is</strong> a tough one to fill (&#x5F88;&#x96BE;&#x80DC;&#x4EFB;). From 2000 to 2013, about a quarter of the CEO <strong>departures</strong> (&#x80CC;&#x79BB;) in the Fortune 500 were <strong>involuntary</strong> (&#x975E;&#x81EA;&#x613F;&#x7684;), according to the Conference Board. The <strong>fallout</strong> (&#xFF08;&#x4E0D;&#x826F;&#xFF09;&#x540E;&#x679C;&#xFF0C;&#x526F;&#x4F5C;&#x7528;) from these <strong>dismissals</strong> (&#x89E3;&#x96C7;&#xFF1B;&#x514D;&#x804C;) can be <strong>staggering</strong> (&#x60CA;&#x4EBA;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x9707;&#x60CA;&#x7684;): <u>Forced turnover at the top</u> (&#x516C;&#x53F8;&#x9AD8;&#x5C42;&#x88AB;&#x8FEB;&#x79BB;&#x804C;) costs shareholders an estimated $112 billion in lost market value annually, a 2014 PwC study of the world&#x2019;s 2,500 largest companies showed. Those figures are discouraging for directors who have the hard task of anointing CEOs&#x2014;and <strong>daunting</strong> (&#x4F7F;&#x4EBA;&#x754F;&#x7F29;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4F7F;&#x4EBA;&#x6C14;&#x9981;&#x7684;) to any leader aspiring to the <strong>C-suite</strong> (&#x6700;&#x9AD8;&#x7BA1;&#x7406;&#x5C42;,C&#x4F4D;). Clearly, many <strong>otherwise</strong> (&#x539F;&#x672C;&#xFF0C;&#x672C;&#x6765;&#xFF1B;&#x5426;&#x5219;&#xFF0C;&#x53E6;&#x5916;) capable leaders and boards are getting something wrong. The question is, what?</p><p>In the more than two decades we&#x2019;ve spent advising boards, investors, and chief executives themselves on CEO transitions, we have seen a fundamental disconnect between what boards think makes for an ideal CEO and what actually leads to high performance. That disconnect starts with an unrealistic yet (&#x4F46;) <strong>pervasive</strong> (&#x666E;&#x904D;&#x7684;) <strong>stereotype</strong> (&#x523B;&#x677F;&#x5370;&#x8C61;), which is shaped in large part by the official bios of <em>Fortune</em> 500 leaders. It holds that a successful CEO is a <strong>charismatic</strong> (&#x8D85;&#x51E1;&#x9B45;&#x529B;&#x7684;) six-foot-tall white man with a degree from a top university, who is a <u><strong>strategic visionary</strong></u> (&#x6218;&#x7565;&#x6709;&#x8FDC;&#x89C1;) with a seemingly direct-to-the-top career path and the ability to make perfect decisions under pressure.</p><p>Yet we&#x2019;ve been struck by how few of the successful leaders we&#x2019;ve <strong>encountered</strong> (&#x9047;&#x5230;) fit this <strong>profile</strong> (&#x4FA7;&#x9762;&#xFF1B;&#x8F6E;&#x5ED3;). That realization led us to embark on a 10-year study, the <a href="http://ceogenome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Genome Project.</a> Its goal is to identify the specific attributes that differentiate high-performing CEOs (whom we define as executives meeting or exceeding expectations in the role, according to interviews with board members and majority investors deeply familiar with the CEOs&#x2019; performance). Partnering with economists at the University of Chicago and Copenhagen Business School and with analysts at SAS Inc., we tapped into a database created by our leadership advisory firm, ghSmart, containing more than 17,000 assessments of C-suite executives, including 2,000 CEOs. The database has in-depth information on each leader&#x2019;s career history, business results, and behavioral patterns. We <strong>sifted</strong> (&#x7B5B;&#x9009;) through that information, looking for what distinguished candidates who got hired as CEOs from those who didn&#x2019;t, and those who excelled in the role from those who <strong>underperformed</strong> (&#x8868;&#x73B0;&#x4E0D;&#x4F73;&#xFF1B;&#x5DE5;&#x4F5C;&#x4E0D;&#x5982;&#x9884;&#x671F;).</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

It is easy for meetings to be dominated by extroverts, who have a tendency to speak the loudest and most often. Introverts may never contribute to the discussion. In his book, &#x201C;Running Meetings That Make Things Happen&#x201D;, Jon Baker says that one answer is to circulate materials well in advance. Introverts, he writes, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t debate something as effectively if they&#x2019;re still learning about it. If you want the views of the more detail-conscious members in your team, give them time to absorb the information.&#x201D;</p><p>Mr Baker also suggests that managers should encourage introverts to contribute to the discussion by asking specific questions of them in their area of expertise. Another approach is to ask people to write down their ideas rather than contribute verbally. In theory, this approach should improve the quality of the discussion; after all, if the views of the introverts aren&#x2019;t valuable, why have they been invited to the meeting?</p><p>What makes life tricky for managers is that people don&#x2019;t have labels on their foreheads stating which kind of personality type they are. Sometimes people make it obvious (like the old joke &#x201C;How do you tell if people went to Harvard?&#x201D; &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll soon tell you&#x201D;). But that means managers have to spend time chatting to, and observing, their team members before deciding how best to get them motivated and inspired. Managers need to be less like Henry Ford, and more like Sigmund Freud.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

And that requires an understanding of the different personality types they may be managing, and indeed the role their own personality may play in the way they manage.</p><p>Karl Moore, an associate professor at McGill University in Canada, has written two recent articles on the role of different personality types in business. One of the most common divides is between introverts and extroverts. Mr Moore estimates that around 40% of the population are introverts, 40% are extroverts and 20% are &#x201C;ambiverts (&#x65E2;&#x5916;&#x5411;&#x53C8;&#x5185;&#x5411;&#x7684;&#x4EBA;&#xFF1B;&#x4E2D;&#x95F4;&#x6027;&#x683C;&#x8005;)&#x201D; who can display both characteristics.</p><p>It is easy to assume that the extroverts are most likely to go far in business. An academic study* found that extroverts were 25% more likely to be in a high-earning job than those who were less outgoing. The chain of <strong>causation</strong> (&#x56E0;&#x679C;&#x5173;&#x7CFB;) is not clear. It is possible that working in a high-paid job makes people more confident and outgoing, although personality traits tend to develop early in life.</p><p>The study also found that the children of professionals were more likely to be extrovert. It could simply be that children who grow up in more prosperous (&#x7E41;&#x8363;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x5174;&#x65FA;&#x7684;) homes are less likely to face the kind of stressful events that undermine self-confidence. People with higher self-confidence may apply for more <strong>prestigious</strong> (&#x4EAB;&#x6709;&#x58F0;&#x671B;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x53D7;&#x5C0A;&#x656C;&#x7684;) jobs and may be more likely to believe that their efforts will be rewarded; those with a negative self-image may feel it is not worth trying too hard.</p><p>So <strong>introverts</strong> should not give up hope of climbing the <strong>greasy</strong> (&#x6CB9;&#x817B;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x542B;&#x8102;&#x80AA;&#x591A;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x8C04;&#x5A9A;&#x7684;) pole. A study in 2017 found that introverts were slightly more likely than extroverts to surpass the expectations of boards and investors when appointed as chief executive.</p><p>Ambiverts can be good salespeople because they are able to listen to their clients and understand their needs but also have the energy to sell their firms&#x2019; goods and services. Mr Moore thinks that successful <strong>executives</strong> (&#x9AD8;&#x7BA1;) have to become ambiverts at times in order to succeed. Introverts must try to show enthusiasm, or make a <strong>stirring</strong> (&#x9F13;&#x821E;&#x7684;) speech, when the situation calls for it. And extroverts need to shut up and listen to their teams&#x2014;<u><strong>not least</strong></u> (&#x5C24;&#x5176;) because when the boss speaks first, <strong>subordinates</strong> (&#x4E0B;&#x7EA7;) will be <strong>reluctant</strong> (&#x4E0D;&#x60C5;&#x613F;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x52C9;&#x5F3A;&#x7684;) to disagree.</p><p>Bartleby (who is an introvert but doesn&#x2019;t like to talk about it much) thinks that the key is not to be too far out on the scale in either direction. An extreme introvert risks seeming too remote to manage a team, and may lack the ability to inspire. But an extreme extrovert can simply overwhelm the business, with other managers unable to constrain them. Perhaps becoming an entrepreneur, or founding a successful firm, requires a significant degree of self-confidence but nobody can get every decision right, and <u>there comes a time</u> (&#x603B;&#x4F1A;&#x6709;&#x8FD9;&#x79CD;&#x65F6;&#x5019;) when a founder needs the expertise of other people.</p><p>* &#x201C;A winning personality: The effects of background on personality and earnings&#x201D;, by Robert de Vries and Jason Rentfrow</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

If I am really struggling to proceed through the paper, I try to look up a review article or a textbook chapter to give me the necessary background to proceed, which I generally find much more efficient.</p><p>There are a lot of acronyms and jargon that can be subfield-specific, so I usually don&#x2019;t wade through the details unless it&#x2019;s for my own research. But I always try to take my time to really understand the methods being used.<br><em>- Shanahan</em></p><p>I will typically pause immediately to look up things I don&#x2019;t understand. The rest of the reading may not make sense if I don&#x2019;t understand a key phrase or <strong>jargon</strong> (&#x884C;&#x8BDD;&#xFF0C;&#x672F;&#x8BED;). This can <strong>backfire</strong> (&#x9002;&#x5F97;&#x5176;&#x53CD;) a bit, though, <u>as I often go down never-ending rabbit holes after looking something up</u> (&#x5C31;&#x50CF;&#x6211;&#x7ECF;&#x5E38;&#x5728;&#x5BFB;&#x627E;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x4E1C;&#x897F;&#x540E;&#x6389;&#x8FDB;&#x6C38;&#x65E0;&#x6B62;&#x5C3D;&#x7684;&#x5154;&#x5B50;&#x6D1E;) (What is X? Oh, X influences Y. &#x2026; So what&#x2019;s Y? etc&#x2026;). This can be sort of fun as you learn how everything is connected, but if you&#x2019;re <u>crunched for time</u> (&#x65F6;&#x95F4;&#x7D27;&#x8FEB;) this can pull your attention away from the task at hand.</p><p>Sometimes, all the jargon in a paper can cloud the whole point of the experiments in the first place. In such cases, it helps to ask yourself, &#x201C;What question were the authors trying to answer?&#x201D; Then you can determine whether they succeeded or failed.<br>- <em>Borniger</em></p><p>It depends on how much the non-understandable bits prevent me from following the main ideas. I usually do not try to understand all the details in all the sections the first time I read a paper. If non-understandable parts appear important for my research, I try to ask colleagues or even contact the lead author directly. Going back to the original references to get all the background information is the last resort, because time can be limited and <strong>collaborations</strong> (&#x5408;&#x4F5C;) and personal contacts can be much more efficient in solving specific problems.<br><em>- Tubiana</em></p><p>Sometimes, you can just read through a paper and any terms you&#x2019;re not familiar with will become clearer by the end. If it is very heavy going, then stopping and seeking additional information is usually the way to go. I do a quick Google search on the topic, theme, method, jargon, etc. If it is a very dense article, sometimes it will require a few <strong>read-throughs</strong> (&#x901A;&#x8BFB;) before it all starts to make sense.<br><em>- Gray</em></p><p>The question I ask myself is, &#x201C;Do I need to understand what that means in order to get what I need from this paper?&#x201D; I now read articles in research areas well outside of my expertise, and I often don&#x2019;t need more than <strong>superficial</strong> (&#x8868;&#x9762;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x80A4;&#x6D45;&#x7684; ) knowledge of the <strong>substantive</strong> (&#x6709;&#x5B9E;&#x8D28;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x5927;&#x91CF;&#x7684;) content. If I can&#x2019;t do anything with the paper unless I don&#x2019;t understand that depth, then I do more background research.<br>- <em>Nosek</em></p><p>Lately, I have had to read a number of papers outside my area of expertise with a lot of unfamiliar jargon. In some cases, I am able to directly extract the information I need from the results or figures and tables. In other cases, I use Google searches to define terms and concepts in the paper or read the cited references to better understand the points being made. Occasionally, papers are so <strong>incomprehensible</strong> ( &#x8D39;&#x89E3;&#x7684;) (to me, at least) that I don&#x2019;t bother reading them.<br>- <em>Fox</em></p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

So for example, when I read for background information, I will save informative sentences from each article about a specific topic in a Word document. I&#x2019;ll write comments along the way about new ideas I got or questions I need to explore further. Then, in the future, I&#x2019;ll only need to read this document instead of re-reading all the individual papers. </p><p>Likewise, when I want to figure out how to conduct a particular experiment, I create a handy table in Excel summarizing how a variety of research teams went about doing a particular experiment.<br>- <a href="http://www.linacolucci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lina A. Colucci</em></a><em>, doctoral candidate at the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program</em></p><p>I usually start with the abstract, which gives me a brief snapshot of what the study is all about. Then I read the entire article, leaving the methods to the end unless I can&#x2019;t make sense of the results or I&#x2019;m unfamiliar with the experiments.</p><p>The results and methods sections allow you to <u>pull apart</u> (&#x6495;&#x5F00;&#xFF0C;&#x626F;&#x65AD;) a paper to ensure it <u>stands up to</u> (&#x7ECF;&#x5F97;&#x8D77;) scientific <strong>rigor</strong> (&#x4E25;&#x5BC6;&#xFF0C;&#x4E25;&#x683C;). Always think about the type of experiments performed, and whether these are the most appropriate to address the question proposed. Ensure that the authors have included relevant and sufficient numbers of controls. Often, conclusions can also be based on a limited number of samples, which limits their significance.</p><p>I like to print out the paper and highlight the most relevant information, so on a quick rescan I can be reminded of the major points. Most relevant points would be things that change your thinking about your research topic or give you new ideas and directions.<br>- <a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au/staff_members/33_lachlan_gray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lachlan Gray</em></a><em>,</em> <em>deputy head of the HIV Neuropathogenesis Lab at the Burnet Institute and adjunct research fellow in the Department of Infectious Disease at Monash</em> <em>University in</em> <em>Melbourne, Australia</em></p><p>What I choose to read is based on relation to my research areas and things that are generating lots of interest and discussion because they are driving the way we do psychology, or science more widely, in new directions. Most often, what I am trying to get out of the papers is issues of methodology, experimental design, and statistical analysis. And so for me, the most important section is first what the authors did (methods) and second what they found (results). </p><p>It can also be interesting to understand why the authors thought they were doing the study (introduction) and what they think the results mean (discussion). When it is an area that I know a lot about, I don&#x2019;t usually care much about these sections because they often reflect the authors&#x2019; theoretical predilections and one of many ways to think about the method and results. But when it is an area that I know very little about, I read these closely because then I learn a lot about the assumptions and explanatory approaches in that area of research.<br>- <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Brian Nosek</em></a><em>, professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Virginia and executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville</em></p><p>First I read very fast: The point of the first reading is simply to see whether the paper is interesting for me. If it is I read it a second time, slower and with more attention to detail.</p><p>If the paper is vital to my research&#x2014;and if it is theoretical&#x2014;I would reinvent the paper. In such cases, I only take the starting point and then work out everything else on my own, not looking into the paper. Sometimes this is a painfully slow process. Sometimes I get angry about the authors not writing clearly enough, omitting essential points and <strong>dwelling</strong> (&#x8BE6;&#x8FF0;) on <strong>superfluous</strong> (&#x591A;&#x4F59;&#x7684;) <strong>nonsense</strong> (&#x5E9F;&#x8BDD;). Sometimes I am <strong>electrified</strong> (&#x4F7F;&#x2026;&#x89E6;&#x7535;&#xFF1B;&#x4F7F;&#x2026;&#x9707;&#x60CA;)  by a paper.<br>- <a href="http://ulfleonhardt.weizmann.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ulf Leonhardt</em></a><em>, professor of physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel</em></p><p>I nearly always read the abstract first and only continue on to the paper if the abstract indicates that the paper will be of value to me. Then, if the topic of the paper is one I know well, I generally skim the introduction, reading its last paragraph to make sure I know the specific question being addressed in the paper. Then I look at the figures and tables, either read or skim the results, and lastly skim or read the discussion.</p><p>If the topic is not one I know well, I usually read the introduction much more carefully so that the study is placed into context for me. Then I skim the figures and tables and read the results.<br>- <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~cfox/chuck.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Charles W. Fox</em></a><em>,</em> <em>professor in the Department of Entomology at the University of Kentucky in Lexington</em></p><p>It is important to realize that shortcuts have to be taken when reading papers so that there is time left to get our other work done, including writing, conducting research, attending meetings, teaching, and grading papers. Starting as a Ph.D. student, I have been reading the conclusions and methods of academic journal articles and chapters rather than entire books.<br>- <a href="http://soci.ubc.ca/persons/rima-wilkes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Rima Wilkes</em></a><em>, professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver</em></p><p>As editor-in-chief (&#x603B;&#x7F16;&#x8F91;) of <em>Science</em>, I have to read and comprehend papers outside of my field all the time. Generally, I start with the corresponding editors&#x2019; summaries, which are meant for someone like me: a science generalist who is interested in everything but dives deeply only into one field. Next, I check to see if someone wrote a News article on the paper. Third, I check to see if there is a Perspective by another scientist. The main goal of a Perspective is to broaden the message of the paper, but often the authors do a great job of extracting the essence of the article for non-specialists at the same time.</p><p>Then I tackle the abstract, which has been written to broadly communicate to the readership of the journal. Finally, I move on to the paper itself, reading, in order, the intro, conclusions, scanning the figures, and then reading the paper through.<br>- <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/about/leadership-and-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Marcia K.

I think the figures are the most important part of the paper, because the abstract and body of the paper can be manipulated and shaped to tell a <strong>compelling</strong> (&#x5F15;&#x4EBA;&#x6CE8;&#x76EE;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x4FE1;&#x670D;&#x7684;) story. Then anything I&#x2019;m unclear about, I head to the methodology.</p><p>If I want to delve (&#x94BB;&#x7814;&#xFF1B;&#x63A2;&#x7A76;) deeper into the paper, I typically read it in its entirety and then also read a few of the previous papers from that group or other articles on the same topic. If there is a reference after a statement that I find particularly interesting or controversial, I also look it up. Should I need more detail, I access any provided data repositories or supplemental information.</p><p>Then, if the authors&#x2019; research is similar to my own, I see if their relevant data match our findings or if there are any inconsistencies. If there are, I think about what could be causing them. Additionally, I think about what would happen in our model if we used the same methods as they did and what we could learn from that. Sometimes, it is also important to pay attention to why the authors decided to conduct an experiment in a certain way. Did the authors use an obscure test instead of a routine assay, and why would they do this?<br>- <a href="https://ngsp.osu.edu/people/jeremy.borniger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Jeremy C. Borniger</em></a><em>, doctoral candidate</em> <em>in neuroscience at Ohio State University, Columbus</em></p><p>I always start with title and abstract. That tells me whether or not it&#x2019;s an article I&#x2019;m interested in and whether I&#x2019;ll actually be able to understand it&#x2014;both scientifically and <strong>linguistically</strong> (&#x8BED;&#x8A00;&#x7684;). I then read the introduction so that I can understand the question being framed, and jump right to the figures and tables so I can get a feel for the data. I then read the discussion to get an idea of how the paper fits into the general body of knowledge.</p><p>I pay attention to acknowledgement of limitations and proper <strong>inference</strong> (&#x63A8;&#x7406;&#xFF1B;&#x63A8;&#x8BBA;) of data. Some people stretch their claims more than others, and that can be a red flag for me. I also put on my epidemiologist hat so that I can try to make sure the study design is adequate to actually test the hypotheses being examined.</p><p>As I go deeper into the argument framing, figures, and discussion, I also think about which pieces are exciting and new, which ones are biologically or logically relevant, and which ones are most supported by the literature. I also consider which pieces fit with my pre-existing hypotheses and research questions.<br>- <a href="http://itims.med.umich.edu/people/kevin-boehnke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Kevin Boehnke</em></a><em>, doctoral candidate in environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</em></p><p>My reading strategy depends on the paper. Sometimes I start by skimming through to see how much might be relevant. If it is directly applicable to my current topic, I&#x2019;ll read the paper closely, apart from the introduction that is probably already familiar. But I always try to figure out if there are particular places or figures that I need to pay close attention to, and then I go and read the related information in the results and discussion.</p><p>I also check if there are references that I may be interested in. Sometimes I am curious to see who in the field has&#x2014;or more likely has not&#x2014;been referenced, to see whether the authors are choosing to ignore certain aspects of the research. I often find that the supplementary figures actually offer the most curious and interesting results, especially if the results relate to parts of the field that the authors did not reference or if they are unclear or unhelpful to their interpretation of the overall story.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

Many of you have come to us asking for more (and more serious) advice on how to <u><strong>make sense of</strong></u> (&#x7406;&#x89E3;) the scientific literature, so we&#x2019;ve asked a dozen scientists at different career stages and in a broad range of fields to tell us how they do it. Although it is clear that reading scientific papers becomes easier with experience, the <strong>stumbling</strong> (&#x969C;&#x788D;&#x7684;) blocks are real, and it is up to each scientist to identify and apply the techniques that work best for them.

We aimed to examine genetic variation in height within the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to determine whether height has a causal effect on risk of atrial fibrillation.</p><h3 id="Methods-and-findings"><a href="#Methods-and-findings" class="headerlink" title="Methods and findings"></a>Methods and findings</h3><p>In summary-level analyses, MR was performed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of height (GIANT/UK Biobank; 693,529 individuals) and atrial fibrillation (AFGen; 65,446 cases and 522,744 controls), finding that each 1-SD increase in genetically predicted height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 1.34; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.40; <em>p</em> = 5 &#xD7; 10&#x2212;42). This result remained consistent in sensitivity analyses with MR methods that make different assumptions about the presence of pleiotropy, and when accounting for the effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on atrial fibrillation. Individual-level phenome-wide association studies of height and a height genetic risk score were performed among 6,567 European-ancestry participants of the Penn Medicine Biobank (median age at enrollment 63 years, interquartile range 55&#x2013;72; 38% female; recruitment 2008&#x2013;2015), confirming prior observational associations between height and atrial fibrillation. Individual-level MR confirmed that each 1-SD increase in height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation, including adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.50 to 2.40; <em>p</em> = 0.007). The main limitations of this study include potential bias from pleiotropic effects of genetic variants, and lack of generalizability of individual-level findings to non-European populations.</p><h3 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h3><p>In this study, we observed evidence that height is likely a positive causal risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Further study is needed to determine whether risk prediction tools including height or anthropometric risk factors can be used to improve screening and primary prevention of atrial fibrillation, and whether biological pathways involved in height may offer new targets for treatment of atrial fibrillation.</p><p>&#x79C1;&#x7528;&#x5B5F;&#x5FB7;&#x5C14;&#x968F;&#x673A;&#x5316;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x8BC1;&#x660E;&#xFF1A;&#x8EAB;&#x9AD8;&#x53EF;&#x80FD;&#x662F;&#x5BFC;&#x81F4;&#x623F;&#x98A4;&#x7684;&#x4E00;&#x4E2A;&#x5371;&#x9669;&#x56E0;&#x7D20;&#x3002;</p><h2 id="Author-summary"><a href="#Author-summary" class="headerlink" title="Author summary"></a>Author summary</h2><h3 id="Why-was-this-study-done"><a href="#Why-was-this-study-done" class="headerlink" title="Why was this study done?"></a>Why was this study done?</h3><ul><li>Studies have identified height as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, a common abnormal heart rhythm.</li><li>Whether being taller actually elevates risk of atrial fibrillation, or if this association is an artifact of prior study designs, remains unclear.</li></ul><h3 id="What-did-the-researchers-do-and-find"><a href="#What-did-the-researchers-do-and-find" class="headerlink" title="What did the researchers do and find?"></a>What did the researchers do and find?</h3><ul><li>We examined randomly allocated genetic variants associated with height within the Mendelian randomization framework to study the effects of height on risk of atrial fibrillation.</li><li>Genetic variants associated with taller stature were also associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

By the time you make it to a top graduate school, almost all your learning has come from people who are smarter and more experienced than you: parents, teachers, bosses. But once you&#x2019;ve finished at Harvard Business School or any other top academic institution, the vast majority of people you&#x2019;ll interact with on a day-to-day basis may not be smarter than you. And if your attitude is that only smarter people have something to teach you, your learning opportunities will be very limited. But if you have a humble eagerness to learn something from everybody, your learning opportunities will be unlimited. Generally, you can be humble only if you feel really good about yourself&#x2014;and you want to help those around you feel really good about themselves, too. When we see people acting in an <strong>abusive</strong> (&#x8FB1;&#x9A82;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x6EE5;&#x7528;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x8650;&#x5F85;&#x7684;), arrogant, or <strong>demeaning</strong> (&#x8D2C;&#x4F4E;) manner toward others, their behavior almost always is a symptom of their lack of self-esteem. They need to put someone else down to feel good about themselves.</p><h2 id="Choose-the-Right-Yardstick-&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;"><a href="#Choose-the-Right-Yardstick-&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;" class="headerlink" title="Choose the Right Yardstick (&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;)"></a>Choose the Right Yardstick (&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;)</h2><p>This past year I was diagnosed with cancer and faced the possibility that my life would end sooner than I&#x2019;d planned. Thankfully, it now looks as if I&#x2019;ll be <strong>spared</strong> (&#x5E78;&#x514D;,&#x5907;&#x4EFD;&#x7684;). But the experience has given me important insight into my life.</p><p>I have a pretty clear idea of how my ideas have generated enormous revenue for companies that have used my research; I know I&#x2019;ve had a substantial impact. But as I&#x2019;ve confronted this disease, it&#x2019;s been interesting to see how unimportant that impact is to me now. I&#x2019;ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn&#x2019;t dollars but the individual people whose lives I&#x2019;ve touched (&#x53D7;&#x611F;&#x52A8;&#x7684;).</p><p>I think that&#x2019;s the way it will work for us all. Don&#x2019;t worry about the level of individual <strong>prominence</strong> (&#x5353;&#x8D8A;) you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people. This is my final recommendation: Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a <strong>resolution</strong> (&#x51B3;&#x5FC3;,&#x89E3;&#x51B3;) to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

I got a very clear feeling that I shouldn&#x2019;t break my commitment&#x2014;so I didn&#x2019;t play in the championship game.</p><p>In many ways that was a small decision&#x2014;involving one of several thousand Sundays in my life. In theory, surely I could have crossed over the line just that one time and then not done it again. But looking back on it, resisting the <strong>temptation</strong> (&#x5F15;&#x8BF1;&#xFF1B;&#x8BF1;&#x60D1;&#x7269;) whose logic was &#x201C;In this <strong>extenuating</strong> (&#x60C5;&#x6709;&#x53EF;&#x539F;&#x7684;) circumstance, just this once, it&#x2019;s OK&#x201D; has proven to be one of the most important decisions of my life. Why? My life has been one <strong>unending</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x5C3D;&#x7684;) stream of extenuating circumstances. Had I crossed the line that one time, I would have done it over and over in the years that followed.</p><p>The lesson I learned from this is that it&#x2019;s easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time. If you give in to &#x201C;just this once,&#x201D; based on a marginal cost analysis, as some of my former classmates have done, you&#x2019;ll regret where you end up. You&#x2019;ve got to define for yourself what you stand for and draw the line in a safe place.</p><h2 id="Remember-the-Importance-of-Humility"><a href="#Remember-the-Importance-of-Humility" class="headerlink" title="Remember the Importance of Humility"></a>Remember the Importance of Humility</h2><p>I got this insight when I was asked to teach a class on humility at Harvard College. I asked all the students to describe the most humble person they knew. One characteristic of these humble people stood out: They had a high level of self-esteem. They knew who they were, and they felt good about who they were. We also decided that humility was defined not by <u>self-deprecating</u> (&#x81EA;&#x8D2C;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x8C26;&#x865A;&#x7684;) behavior or attitudes but by the esteem with which you regard others. Good behavior flows naturally from that kind of humility. For example, you would never steal from someone, because you respect that person too much. You&#x2019;d never lie to someone, either.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

We learn in our course that this <strong>doctrine</strong> (&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#xFF1B;&#x5B66;&#x8BF4;&#xFF1B;&#x6559;&#x4E49;) biases companies to leverage what they have put in place to succeed in the past, instead of guiding them to create the capabilities they&#x2019;ll need in the future. If we knew the future would be exactly the same as the past, that approach would be fine. But if the future&#x2019;s different&#x2014;and it almost always is&#x2014;then it&#x2019;s the wrong thing to do.</p><p>This theory addresses the third question I discuss with my students&#x2014;how to live a life of integrity (stay out of jail). Unconsciously, we often employ the marginal cost doctrine in our personal lives when we choose between right and wrong. A voice in our head says, &#x201C;Look, I know that as a general rule, most people shouldn&#x2019;t do this. But in this particular <u>extenuating circumstance,</u> (&#x60C5;&#x6709;&#x53EF;&#x539F;&#x7684;&#x60C5;&#x51B5;) just this once, it&#x2019;s OK.&#x201D; The marginal cost of doing something wrong &#x201C;just this once&#x201D; always seems <strong>alluringly</strong> (&#x8BF1;&#x4EBA;&#x5730;) low. It suckers (&#x5438;) you in, and you don&#x2019;t ever look at where that path ultimately is headed and at the full costs that the choice entails. Justification for <strong>infidelity</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x4FE1;&#x4EF0;) and dishonesty in all their <strong>manifestations</strong> (&#x8868;&#x73B0;) lies in the marginal cost economics of &#x201C;just this once.&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to share a story about how I came to understand the potential damage of &#x201C;just this once&#x201D; in my own life. I played on the Oxford University <strong>varsity</strong> (&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#xFF1B;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x8FD0;&#x52A8;&#x4EE3;&#x8868;&#x961F;) basketball team. <u><strong>We worked our tails off</strong> and finished the season undefeated</u> (&#x6211;&#x4EEC;&#x7AED;&#x5C3D;&#x5168;&#x529B;&#xFF0C;&#x5B8C;&#x6210;&#x4E86;&#x4E0D;&#x8D25;&#x7684;&#x8D5B;&#x5B63;). The guys on the team were the best friends I&#x2019;ve ever had in my life. We got to the British <strong>equivalent</strong> (&#x76F8;&#x7B49;&#x7684;) of the NCAA <strong>tournament</strong> (&#x9526;&#x6807;&#x8D5B;&#xFF0C;&#x8054;&#x8D5B;)&#x2014;and made it to the final four. It turned out the championship game was scheduled to be played on a Sunday. I had made a personal commitment to God at age 16 that I would never play ball on Sunday. So I went to the coach and explained my problem. He was <strong>incredulous</strong> (&#x6000;&#x7591;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x96BE;&#x4EE5;&#x7F6E;&#x4FE1;&#x7684;). My teammates were, too, because I was the starting center. Every one of the guys on the team came to me and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to play. Can&#x2019;t you break the rule just this one time?&#x201D;</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

Many companies start in this <strong>quadrant</strong> (&#x8C61;&#x9650;), which is why <u>the founding executive team</u> (&#x521B;&#x59CB;&#x6267;&#x884C;&#x56E2;&#x961F;) must play such an <strong>assertive</strong> (&#x72EC;&#x65AD;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x80AF;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;) role in defining what must be done and how. If employees&#x2019; ways of working together to address those tasks succeed over and over, consensus begins to form. MIT&#x2019;s Edgar Schein has described this process as the mechanism by which a culture is built. Ultimately, people don&#x2019;t even think about whether their way of doing things yields success. They embrace priorities and follow procedures by instinct and assumption rather than by explicit decision&#x2014;which means that they&#x2019;ve created a culture. Culture, in <strong>compelling</strong> (&#x5F15;&#x4EBA;&#x6CE8;&#x76EE;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x4FE1;&#x670D;&#x7684;) but unspoken ways, <strong>dictates</strong> (&#x89C4;&#x5B9A;) the proven (&#x88AB;&#x9A8C;&#x8BC1;&#x7684;), acceptable methods by which members of the group address recurrent problems. And culture defines the priority given to different types of problems. It can be a powerful management tool.</p><p>In using this model to address the question, How can I be sure that my family becomes an enduring source of happiness?, my students quickly see that the simplest tools that parents can wield to elicit cooperation from children are <u>power tools</u> (&#x7535;&#x52A8;&#x5DE5;&#x5177;). But there comes a point during the teen years when power tools no longer work. At that point parents start wishing that they had begun working with their children at a very young age to build a culture at home in which children instinctively behave respectfully toward one another, <strong>obey</strong> (&#x670D;&#x4ECE;) their parents, and choose the right thing to do. Families have cultures, just as companies do. Those cultures can be built consciously or evolve (&#x8FDB;&#x5316;) <strong>inadvertently</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x610F;&#x5730;&#xFF0C;&#x4E0D;&#x7ECF;&#x610F;&#x5730;).</p><p>If you want your kids to have strong self-esteem and confidence that they can solve hard problems, those qualities won&#x2019;t magically materialize in high school. You have to design them into your family&#x2019;s culture&#x2014;and you have to think about this very <strong><u>early on</u></strong> (&#x5728;&#x65E9;&#x671F;). Like employees, children build self-esteem by doing things that are hard and learning what works.</p><p><strong>inadvertently: </strong> &#x65E0;&#x610F;&#x5730;&#xFF0C;&#x4E0D;&#x7ECF;&#x610F;&#x5730; (unconsciousness)</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>
