Too many CEOs <strong>falter</strong> (&#x8870;&#x5F31;&#xFF1B;&#x8870;&#x9000;) in the job; about a quarter of the <em>Fortune</em> 500 chiefs who leave their firms each year are forced out. Clearly, boards do not always get their hires right.In conducting an analysis of in-depth assessments of 17,000 executives, the authors uncovered a large disconnect between what directors <em>think</em> makes for an ideal CEO and what <em>actually leads</em> to high performance. The findings of their 10-year research project challenge many widely held assumptions. Charisma, confidence, and pedigree all have little bearing on CEO success, it turns out. Instead, top performers demonstrate four specific business behaviors: (1) <u>They&#x2019;re <strong>decisive</strong> (&#x679C;&#x65AD;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x575A;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;), realizing they can&#x2019;t wait for perfect information and that a wrong decision is often better than no decision</u>. (2) They engage for impact, working to understand the priorities of stakeholders and then aligning them around a goal of value creation. (3) They adapt <strong>proactively</strong> (&#x524D;&#x6444;&#x5730;&#xFF1B;&#x4E3B;&#x52A8;&#x5730;), keeping an eye on the long term and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. (4) They deliver results in a reliable fashion, steadily following through on commitments (&#x4ED6;&#x4EEC;&#x4EE5;&#x53EF;&#x9760;&#x7684;&#x65B9;&#x5F0F;&#x4EA4;&#x4ED8;&#x7ED3;&#x679C;, &#x7A33;&#x6B65;&#x5C65;&#x884C;&#x627F;&#x8BFA;).</p><p><strong>The chief executive role is</strong> a tough one to fill (&#x5F88;&#x96BE;&#x80DC;&#x4EFB;). From 2000 to 2013, about a quarter of the CEO <strong>departures</strong> (&#x80CC;&#x79BB;) in the Fortune 500 were <strong>involuntary</strong> (&#x975E;&#x81EA;&#x613F;&#x7684;), according to the Conference Board. The <strong>fallout</strong> (&#xFF08;&#x4E0D;&#x826F;&#xFF09;&#x540E;&#x679C;&#xFF0C;&#x526F;&#x4F5C;&#x7528;) from these <strong>dismissals</strong> (&#x89E3;&#x96C7;&#xFF1B;&#x514D;&#x804C;) can be <strong>staggering</strong> (&#x60CA;&#x4EBA;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x9707;&#x60CA;&#x7684;): <u>Forced turnover at the top</u> (&#x516C;&#x53F8;&#x9AD8;&#x5C42;&#x88AB;&#x8FEB;&#x79BB;&#x804C;) costs shareholders an estimated $112 billion in lost market value annually, a 2014 PwC study of the world&#x2019;s 2,500 largest companies showed. Those figures are discouraging for directors who have the hard task of anointing CEOs&#x2014;and <strong>daunting</strong> (&#x4F7F;&#x4EBA;&#x754F;&#x7F29;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4F7F;&#x4EBA;&#x6C14;&#x9981;&#x7684;) to any leader aspiring to the <strong>C-suite</strong> (&#x6700;&#x9AD8;&#x7BA1;&#x7406;&#x5C42;,C&#x4F4D;). Clearly, many <strong>otherwise</strong> (&#x539F;&#x672C;&#xFF0C;&#x672C;&#x6765;&#xFF1B;&#x5426;&#x5219;&#xFF0C;&#x53E6;&#x5916;) capable leaders and boards are getting something wrong. The question is, what?</p><p>In the more than two decades we&#x2019;ve spent advising boards, investors, and chief executives themselves on CEO transitions, we have seen a fundamental disconnect between what boards think makes for an ideal CEO and what actually leads to high performance. That disconnect starts with an unrealistic yet (&#x4F46;) <strong>pervasive</strong> (&#x666E;&#x904D;&#x7684;) <strong>stereotype</strong> (&#x523B;&#x677F;&#x5370;&#x8C61;), which is shaped in large part by the official bios of <em>Fortune</em> 500 leaders. It holds that a successful CEO is a <strong>charismatic</strong> (&#x8D85;&#x51E1;&#x9B45;&#x529B;&#x7684;) six-foot-tall white man with a degree from a top university, who is a <u><strong>strategic visionary</strong></u> (&#x6218;&#x7565;&#x6709;&#x8FDC;&#x89C1;) with a seemingly direct-to-the-top career path and the ability to make perfect decisions under pressure.</p><p>Yet we&#x2019;ve been struck by how few of the successful leaders we&#x2019;ve <strong>encountered</strong> (&#x9047;&#x5230;) fit this <strong>profile</strong> (&#x4FA7;&#x9762;&#xFF1B;&#x8F6E;&#x5ED3;). That realization led us to embark on a 10-year study, the <a href="http://ceogenome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Genome Project.</a> Its goal is to identify the specific attributes that differentiate high-performing CEOs (whom we define as executives meeting or exceeding expectations in the role, according to interviews with board members and majority investors deeply familiar with the CEOs&#x2019; performance). Partnering with economists at the University of Chicago and Copenhagen Business School and with analysts at SAS Inc., we tapped into a database created by our leadership advisory firm, ghSmart, containing more than 17,000 assessments of C-suite executives, including 2,000 CEOs. The database has in-depth information on each leader&#x2019;s career history, business results, and behavioral patterns. We <strong>sifted</strong> (&#x7B5B;&#x9009;) through that information, looking for what distinguished candidates who got hired as CEOs from those who didn&#x2019;t, and those who excelled in the role from those who <strong>underperformed</strong> (&#x8868;&#x73B0;&#x4E0D;&#x4F73;&#xFF1B;&#x5DE5;&#x4F5C;&#x4E0D;&#x5982;&#x9884;&#x671F;).</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

It is easy for meetings to be dominated by extroverts, who have a tendency to speak the loudest and most often. Introverts may never contribute to the discussion. In his book, &#x201C;Running Meetings That Make Things Happen&#x201D;, Jon Baker says that one answer is to circulate materials well in advance. Introverts, he writes, &#x201C;don&#x2019;t debate something as effectively if they&#x2019;re still learning about it. If you want the views of the more detail-conscious members in your team, give them time to absorb the information.&#x201D;</p><p>Mr Baker also suggests that managers should encourage introverts to contribute to the discussion by asking specific questions of them in their area of expertise. Another approach is to ask people to write down their ideas rather than contribute verbally. In theory, this approach should improve the quality of the discussion; after all, if the views of the introverts aren&#x2019;t valuable, why have they been invited to the meeting?</p><p>What makes life tricky for managers is that people don&#x2019;t have labels on their foreheads stating which kind of personality type they are. Sometimes people make it obvious (like the old joke &#x201C;How do you tell if people went to Harvard?&#x201D; &#x201C;They&#x2019;ll soon tell you&#x201D;). But that means managers have to spend time chatting to, and observing, their team members before deciding how best to get them motivated and inspired. Managers need to be less like Henry Ford, and more like Sigmund Freud.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

And that requires an understanding of the different personality types they may be managing, and indeed the role their own personality may play in the way they manage.</p><p>Karl Moore, an associate professor at McGill University in Canada, has written two recent articles on the role of different personality types in business. One of the most common divides is between introverts and extroverts. Mr Moore estimates that around 40% of the population are introverts, 40% are extroverts and 20% are &#x201C;ambiverts (&#x65E2;&#x5916;&#x5411;&#x53C8;&#x5185;&#x5411;&#x7684;&#x4EBA;&#xFF1B;&#x4E2D;&#x95F4;&#x6027;&#x683C;&#x8005;)&#x201D; who can display both characteristics.</p><p>It is easy to assume that the extroverts are most likely to go far in business. An academic study* found that extroverts were 25% more likely to be in a high-earning job than those who were less outgoing. The chain of <strong>causation</strong> (&#x56E0;&#x679C;&#x5173;&#x7CFB;) is not clear. It is possible that working in a high-paid job makes people more confident and outgoing, although personality traits tend to develop early in life.</p><p>The study also found that the children of professionals were more likely to be extrovert. It could simply be that children who grow up in more prosperous (&#x7E41;&#x8363;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x5174;&#x65FA;&#x7684;) homes are less likely to face the kind of stressful events that undermine self-confidence. People with higher self-confidence may apply for more <strong>prestigious</strong> (&#x4EAB;&#x6709;&#x58F0;&#x671B;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x53D7;&#x5C0A;&#x656C;&#x7684;) jobs and may be more likely to believe that their efforts will be rewarded; those with a negative self-image may feel it is not worth trying too hard.</p><p>So <strong>introverts</strong> should not give up hope of climbing the <strong>greasy</strong> (&#x6CB9;&#x817B;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x542B;&#x8102;&#x80AA;&#x591A;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x8C04;&#x5A9A;&#x7684;) pole. A study in 2017 found that introverts were slightly more likely than extroverts to surpass the expectations of boards and investors when appointed as chief executive.</p><p>Ambiverts can be good salespeople because they are able to listen to their clients and understand their needs but also have the energy to sell their firms&#x2019; goods and services. Mr Moore thinks that successful <strong>executives</strong> (&#x9AD8;&#x7BA1;) have to become ambiverts at times in order to succeed. Introverts must try to show enthusiasm, or make a <strong>stirring</strong> (&#x9F13;&#x821E;&#x7684;) speech, when the situation calls for it. And extroverts need to shut up and listen to their teams&#x2014;<u><strong>not least</strong></u> (&#x5C24;&#x5176;) because when the boss speaks first, <strong>subordinates</strong> (&#x4E0B;&#x7EA7;) will be <strong>reluctant</strong> (&#x4E0D;&#x60C5;&#x613F;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x52C9;&#x5F3A;&#x7684;) to disagree.</p><p>Bartleby (who is an introvert but doesn&#x2019;t like to talk about it much) thinks that the key is not to be too far out on the scale in either direction. An extreme introvert risks seeming too remote to manage a team, and may lack the ability to inspire. But an extreme extrovert can simply overwhelm the business, with other managers unable to constrain them. Perhaps becoming an entrepreneur, or founding a successful firm, requires a significant degree of self-confidence but nobody can get every decision right, and <u>there comes a time</u> (&#x603B;&#x4F1A;&#x6709;&#x8FD9;&#x79CD;&#x65F6;&#x5019;) when a founder needs the expertise of other people.</p><p>* &#x201C;A winning personality: The effects of background on personality and earnings&#x201D;, by Robert de Vries and Jason Rentfrow</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

If the paper is relevant to a problem I am trying to solve, you can be sure that there are key things in the paper that I do not understand. That confusion is not a threat; it is an opportunity. I am <a href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.short" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignorant (&#x65E0;&#x77E5;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x611A;&#x6627;&#x7684;)</a>; I need to become less ignorant. This paper may help me.</p><p><strong>Simultaneously</strong> (&#x540C;&#x65F6;&#x5730;), some papers are written terribly and are not worth the effort. Someone else has surely written about the concepts more clearly so that I can keep my confusion focused on understanding substance rather than poor grammar.<br>- <em>Nosek</em></p><p>I especially get overwhelmed if it&#x2019;s not in my subfield, if it&#x2019;s long, and if it&#x2019;s full of technical jargon. When this happens, I break it down into chunks and will read it over the course of a few days, if possible. For really difficult papers, it also helps to sit down and work through it with a colleague.<br>- <em>Shanahan</em></p><p>Yes, many times. This is why I developed my own reading strategies, by talking to other scientists and <strong><u>by trial and error</u></strong> (&#x53CD;&#x590D;&#x8BD5;&#x9A8C;&#xFF0C;&#x4E0D;&#x65AD;&#x6478;&#x7D22;). I also have thrown up my hands in <strong>frustration</strong> (&#x632B;&#x6298;&#xFF0C;&#x5931;&#x8D25;) and <strong>tossed</strong> (&#x6254;) the <strong>offending</strong> (&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x4E0D;&#x5FEB;&#x7684;) papers away, never to read them again.<br>- <em>Boehnke</em></p><p>Yes, and in these cases you have to realize that some papers are the result of years of work by dozens of scientists. Expecting to digest and understand everything in it in one afternoon is a <strong>far-fetched</strong> (&#x7275;&#x5F3A;&#x9644;&#x4F1A;&#x7684;, &#x4E0D;&#x9760;&#x8C31;&#x7684;) idea.<br>- <em>Borniger</em></p><p>I have often felt overwhelmed! But certain sections might not need as deep an understanding as others. You also need to know your own limits: Are there some parts of the paper that you would like to emulate but are not part of your expertise and might become &#x201C;accessible&#x201D; through collaborations?<br>- <em>Tubiana</em></p><p>If I feel the paper is very important to what I&#x2019;m doing, I&#x2019;ll leave it a while and go back to it again a couple of times. But if it&#x2019;s too overwhelming, then I have to leave it aside, unless someone among the colleagues I have contacted has been able to interpret it.<br><em>- McDowell</em></p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

If I am really struggling to proceed through the paper, I try to look up a review article or a textbook chapter to give me the necessary background to proceed, which I generally find much more efficient.</p><p>There are a lot of acronyms and jargon that can be subfield-specific, so I usually don&#x2019;t wade through the details unless it&#x2019;s for my own research. But I always try to take my time to really understand the methods being used.<br><em>- Shanahan</em></p><p>I will typically pause immediately to look up things I don&#x2019;t understand. The rest of the reading may not make sense if I don&#x2019;t understand a key phrase or <strong>jargon</strong> (&#x884C;&#x8BDD;&#xFF0C;&#x672F;&#x8BED;). This can <strong>backfire</strong> (&#x9002;&#x5F97;&#x5176;&#x53CD;) a bit, though, <u>as I often go down never-ending rabbit holes after looking something up</u> (&#x5C31;&#x50CF;&#x6211;&#x7ECF;&#x5E38;&#x5728;&#x5BFB;&#x627E;&#x4EC0;&#x4E48;&#x4E1C;&#x897F;&#x540E;&#x6389;&#x8FDB;&#x6C38;&#x65E0;&#x6B62;&#x5C3D;&#x7684;&#x5154;&#x5B50;&#x6D1E;) (What is X? Oh, X influences Y. &#x2026; So what&#x2019;s Y? etc&#x2026;). This can be sort of fun as you learn how everything is connected, but if you&#x2019;re <u>crunched for time</u> (&#x65F6;&#x95F4;&#x7D27;&#x8FEB;) this can pull your attention away from the task at hand.</p><p>Sometimes, all the jargon in a paper can cloud the whole point of the experiments in the first place. In such cases, it helps to ask yourself, &#x201C;What question were the authors trying to answer?&#x201D; Then you can determine whether they succeeded or failed.<br>- <em>Borniger</em></p><p>It depends on how much the non-understandable bits prevent me from following the main ideas. I usually do not try to understand all the details in all the sections the first time I read a paper. If non-understandable parts appear important for my research, I try to ask colleagues or even contact the lead author directly. Going back to the original references to get all the background information is the last resort, because time can be limited and <strong>collaborations</strong> (&#x5408;&#x4F5C;) and personal contacts can be much more efficient in solving specific problems.<br><em>- Tubiana</em></p><p>Sometimes, you can just read through a paper and any terms you&#x2019;re not familiar with will become clearer by the end. If it is very heavy going, then stopping and seeking additional information is usually the way to go. I do a quick Google search on the topic, theme, method, jargon, etc. If it is a very dense article, sometimes it will require a few <strong>read-throughs</strong> (&#x901A;&#x8BFB;) before it all starts to make sense.<br><em>- Gray</em></p><p>The question I ask myself is, &#x201C;Do I need to understand what that means in order to get what I need from this paper?&#x201D; I now read articles in research areas well outside of my expertise, and I often don&#x2019;t need more than <strong>superficial</strong> (&#x8868;&#x9762;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x80A4;&#x6D45;&#x7684; ) knowledge of the <strong>substantive</strong> (&#x6709;&#x5B9E;&#x8D28;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x5927;&#x91CF;&#x7684;) content. If I can&#x2019;t do anything with the paper unless I don&#x2019;t understand that depth, then I do more background research.<br>- <em>Nosek</em></p><p>Lately, I have had to read a number of papers outside my area of expertise with a lot of unfamiliar jargon. In some cases, I am able to directly extract the information I need from the results or figures and tables. In other cases, I use Google searches to define terms and concepts in the paper or read the cited references to better understand the points being made. Occasionally, papers are so <strong>incomprehensible</strong> ( &#x8D39;&#x89E3;&#x7684;) (to me, at least) that I don&#x2019;t bother reading them.<br>- <em>Fox</em></p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

So for example, when I read for background information, I will save informative sentences from each article about a specific topic in a Word document. I&#x2019;ll write comments along the way about new ideas I got or questions I need to explore further. Then, in the future, I&#x2019;ll only need to read this document instead of re-reading all the individual papers. </p><p>Likewise, when I want to figure out how to conduct a particular experiment, I create a handy table in Excel summarizing how a variety of research teams went about doing a particular experiment.<br>- <a href="http://www.linacolucci.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lina A. Colucci</em></a><em>, doctoral candidate at the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program</em></p><p>I usually start with the abstract, which gives me a brief snapshot of what the study is all about. Then I read the entire article, leaving the methods to the end unless I can&#x2019;t make sense of the results or I&#x2019;m unfamiliar with the experiments.</p><p>The results and methods sections allow you to <u>pull apart</u> (&#x6495;&#x5F00;&#xFF0C;&#x626F;&#x65AD;) a paper to ensure it <u>stands up to</u> (&#x7ECF;&#x5F97;&#x8D77;) scientific <strong>rigor</strong> (&#x4E25;&#x5BC6;&#xFF0C;&#x4E25;&#x683C;). Always think about the type of experiments performed, and whether these are the most appropriate to address the question proposed. Ensure that the authors have included relevant and sufficient numbers of controls. Often, conclusions can also be based on a limited number of samples, which limits their significance.</p><p>I like to print out the paper and highlight the most relevant information, so on a quick rescan I can be reminded of the major points. Most relevant points would be things that change your thinking about your research topic or give you new ideas and directions.<br>- <a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au/staff_members/33_lachlan_gray" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lachlan Gray</em></a><em>,</em> <em>deputy head of the HIV Neuropathogenesis Lab at the Burnet Institute and adjunct research fellow in the Department of Infectious Disease at Monash</em> <em>University in</em> <em>Melbourne, Australia</em></p><p>What I choose to read is based on relation to my research areas and things that are generating lots of interest and discussion because they are driving the way we do psychology, or science more widely, in new directions. Most often, what I am trying to get out of the papers is issues of methodology, experimental design, and statistical analysis. And so for me, the most important section is first what the authors did (methods) and second what they found (results). </p><p>It can also be interesting to understand why the authors thought they were doing the study (introduction) and what they think the results mean (discussion). When it is an area that I know a lot about, I don&#x2019;t usually care much about these sections because they often reflect the authors&#x2019; theoretical predilections and one of many ways to think about the method and results. But when it is an area that I know very little about, I read these closely because then I learn a lot about the assumptions and explanatory approaches in that area of research.<br>- <a href="http://projectimplicit.net/nosek/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Brian Nosek</em></a><em>, professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Virginia and executive director of the Center for Open Science in Charlottesville</em></p><p>First I read very fast: The point of the first reading is simply to see whether the paper is interesting for me. If it is I read it a second time, slower and with more attention to detail.</p><p>If the paper is vital to my research&#x2014;and if it is theoretical&#x2014;I would reinvent the paper. In such cases, I only take the starting point and then work out everything else on my own, not looking into the paper. Sometimes this is a painfully slow process. Sometimes I get angry about the authors not writing clearly enough, omitting essential points and <strong>dwelling</strong> (&#x8BE6;&#x8FF0;) on <strong>superfluous</strong> (&#x591A;&#x4F59;&#x7684;) <strong>nonsense</strong> (&#x5E9F;&#x8BDD;). Sometimes I am <strong>electrified</strong> (&#x4F7F;&#x2026;&#x89E6;&#x7535;&#xFF1B;&#x4F7F;&#x2026;&#x9707;&#x60CA;)  by a paper.<br>- <a href="http://ulfleonhardt.weizmann.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ulf Leonhardt</em></a><em>, professor of physics at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel</em></p><p>I nearly always read the abstract first and only continue on to the paper if the abstract indicates that the paper will be of value to me. Then, if the topic of the paper is one I know well, I generally skim the introduction, reading its last paragraph to make sure I know the specific question being addressed in the paper. Then I look at the figures and tables, either read or skim the results, and lastly skim or read the discussion.</p><p>If the topic is not one I know well, I usually read the introduction much more carefully so that the study is placed into context for me. Then I skim the figures and tables and read the results.<br>- <a href="http://www.uky.edu/~cfox/chuck.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Charles W. Fox</em></a><em>,</em> <em>professor in the Department of Entomology at the University of Kentucky in Lexington</em></p><p>It is important to realize that shortcuts have to be taken when reading papers so that there is time left to get our other work done, including writing, conducting research, attending meetings, teaching, and grading papers. Starting as a Ph.D. student, I have been reading the conclusions and methods of academic journal articles and chapters rather than entire books.<br>- <a href="http://soci.ubc.ca/persons/rima-wilkes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Rima Wilkes</em></a><em>, professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver</em></p><p>As editor-in-chief (&#x603B;&#x7F16;&#x8F91;) of <em>Science</em>, I have to read and comprehend papers outside of my field all the time. Generally, I start with the corresponding editors&#x2019; summaries, which are meant for someone like me: a science generalist who is interested in everything but dives deeply only into one field. Next, I check to see if someone wrote a News article on the paper. Third, I check to see if there is a Perspective by another scientist. The main goal of a Perspective is to broaden the message of the paper, but often the authors do a great job of extracting the essence of the article for non-specialists at the same time.</p><p>Then I tackle the abstract, which has been written to broadly communicate to the readership of the journal. Finally, I move on to the paper itself, reading, in order, the intro, conclusions, scanning the figures, and then reading the paper through.<br>- <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/about/leadership-and-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Marcia K.

I think the figures are the most important part of the paper, because the abstract and body of the paper can be manipulated and shaped to tell a <strong>compelling</strong> (&#x5F15;&#x4EBA;&#x6CE8;&#x76EE;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x4FE1;&#x670D;&#x7684;) story. Then anything I&#x2019;m unclear about, I head to the methodology.</p><p>If I want to delve (&#x94BB;&#x7814;&#xFF1B;&#x63A2;&#x7A76;) deeper into the paper, I typically read it in its entirety and then also read a few of the previous papers from that group or other articles on the same topic. If there is a reference after a statement that I find particularly interesting or controversial, I also look it up. Should I need more detail, I access any provided data repositories or supplemental information.</p><p>Then, if the authors&#x2019; research is similar to my own, I see if their relevant data match our findings or if there are any inconsistencies. If there are, I think about what could be causing them. Additionally, I think about what would happen in our model if we used the same methods as they did and what we could learn from that. Sometimes, it is also important to pay attention to why the authors decided to conduct an experiment in a certain way. Did the authors use an obscure test instead of a routine assay, and why would they do this?<br>- <a href="https://ngsp.osu.edu/people/jeremy.borniger" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Jeremy C. Borniger</em></a><em>, doctoral candidate</em> <em>in neuroscience at Ohio State University, Columbus</em></p><p>I always start with title and abstract. That tells me whether or not it&#x2019;s an article I&#x2019;m interested in and whether I&#x2019;ll actually be able to understand it&#x2014;both scientifically and <strong>linguistically</strong> (&#x8BED;&#x8A00;&#x7684;). I then read the introduction so that I can understand the question being framed, and jump right to the figures and tables so I can get a feel for the data. I then read the discussion to get an idea of how the paper fits into the general body of knowledge.</p><p>I pay attention to acknowledgement of limitations and proper <strong>inference</strong> (&#x63A8;&#x7406;&#xFF1B;&#x63A8;&#x8BBA;) of data. Some people stretch their claims more than others, and that can be a red flag for me. I also put on my epidemiologist hat so that I can try to make sure the study design is adequate to actually test the hypotheses being examined.</p><p>As I go deeper into the argument framing, figures, and discussion, I also think about which pieces are exciting and new, which ones are biologically or logically relevant, and which ones are most supported by the literature. I also consider which pieces fit with my pre-existing hypotheses and research questions.<br>- <a href="http://itims.med.umich.edu/people/kevin-boehnke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Kevin Boehnke</em></a><em>, doctoral candidate in environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</em></p><p>My reading strategy depends on the paper. Sometimes I start by skimming through to see how much might be relevant. If it is directly applicable to my current topic, I&#x2019;ll read the paper closely, apart from the introduction that is probably already familiar. But I always try to figure out if there are particular places or figures that I need to pay close attention to, and then I go and read the related information in the results and discussion.</p><p>I also check if there are references that I may be interested in. Sometimes I am curious to see who in the field has&#x2014;or more likely has not&#x2014;been referenced, to see whether the authors are choosing to ignore certain aspects of the research. I often find that the supplementary figures actually offer the most curious and interesting results, especially if the results relate to parts of the field that the authors did not reference or if they are unclear or unhelpful to their interpretation of the overall story.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

Many of you have come to us asking for more (and more serious) advice on how to <u><strong>make sense of</strong></u> (&#x7406;&#x89E3;) the scientific literature, so we&#x2019;ve asked a dozen scientists at different career stages and in a broad range of fields to tell us how they do it. Although it is clear that reading scientific papers becomes easier with experience, the <strong>stumbling</strong> (&#x969C;&#x788D;&#x7684;) blocks are real, and it is up to each scientist to identify and apply the techniques that work best for them. The responses have been edited for clarity and brevity.</p><h2 id="How-do-you-approach-reading-a-paper"><a href="#How-do-you-approach-reading-a-paper" class="headerlink" title="How do you approach reading a paper?"></a>How do you approach reading a paper?</h2><p>I start by reading the abstract. Then, I skim the introduction and flip through the article to look at the figures. I try to identify the most prominent one or two figures, and I really make sure I understand what&#x2019;s going on in them. Then, I read the conclusion/summary. Only when I have done that will I go back into the technical details to clarify any questions I might have.<br>- <a href="http://enceladosaur.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Jesse Shanahan</em></a><em>,</em> <u><em>master&#x2019;s candidate in astronomy</em></u> (&#x5929;&#x6587;&#x5B66;&#x7855;&#x58EB;&#x7814;&#x7A76;&#x751F;) <em>at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut</em></p><p>I first get a general idea by reading the abstract and conclusions. The conclusions help me understand if the goal summarized in the abstract has been reached, and if the described work can be of interest for my own study. I also always look at plots/figures, as they help me get a first impression of a paper. Then I usually read the entire article from beginning to end, going through the sections in the order they appear so that I can follow the flow of work that the authors want to communicate.</p><p>If you want to make it a productive exercise, you need to have a clear idea of which kind of information you need to get in the first place, and then focus on that aspect. It could be to compare your results with the ones presented by the authors, put your own analysis into context, or extend it using the newly published data. Citation lists can help you decide why the paper may be most relevant to you by giving you a first impression of how colleagues that do similar research as you do may have used the paper.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

We aimed to examine genetic variation in height within the Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to determine whether height has a causal effect on risk of atrial fibrillation.</p><h3 id="Methods-and-findings"><a href="#Methods-and-findings" class="headerlink" title="Methods and findings"></a>Methods and findings</h3><p>In summary-level analyses, MR was performed using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of height (GIANT/UK Biobank; 693,529 individuals) and atrial fibrillation (AFGen; 65,446 cases and 522,744 controls), finding that each 1-SD increase in genetically predicted height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 1.34; 95% CI 1.29 to 1.40; <em>p</em> = 5 &#xD7; 10&#x2212;42). This result remained consistent in sensitivity analyses with MR methods that make different assumptions about the presence of pleiotropy, and when accounting for the effects of traditional cardiovascular risk factors on atrial fibrillation. Individual-level phenome-wide association studies of height and a height genetic risk score were performed among 6,567 European-ancestry participants of the Penn Medicine Biobank (median age at enrollment 63 years, interquartile range 55&#x2013;72; 38% female; recruitment 2008&#x2013;2015), confirming prior observational associations between height and atrial fibrillation. Individual-level MR confirmed that each 1-SD increase in height increased the odds of atrial fibrillation, including adjustment for clinical and echocardiographic confounders (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.50 to 2.40; <em>p</em> = 0.007). The main limitations of this study include potential bias from pleiotropic effects of genetic variants, and lack of generalizability of individual-level findings to non-European populations.</p><h3 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h3><p>In this study, we observed evidence that height is likely a positive causal risk factor for atrial fibrillation. Further study is needed to determine whether risk prediction tools including height or anthropometric risk factors can be used to improve screening and primary prevention of atrial fibrillation, and whether biological pathways involved in height may offer new targets for treatment of atrial fibrillation.</p><p>&#x79C1;&#x7528;&#x5B5F;&#x5FB7;&#x5C14;&#x968F;&#x673A;&#x5316;&#x5206;&#x6790;&#x8BC1;&#x660E;&#xFF1A;&#x8EAB;&#x9AD8;&#x53EF;&#x80FD;&#x662F;&#x5BFC;&#x81F4;&#x623F;&#x98A4;&#x7684;&#x4E00;&#x4E2A;&#x5371;&#x9669;&#x56E0;&#x7D20;&#x3002;</p><h2 id="Author-summary"><a href="#Author-summary" class="headerlink" title="Author summary"></a>Author summary</h2><h3 id="Why-was-this-study-done"><a href="#Why-was-this-study-done" class="headerlink" title="Why was this study done?"></a>Why was this study done?</h3><ul><li>Studies have identified height as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, a common abnormal heart rhythm.</li><li>Whether being taller actually elevates risk of atrial fibrillation, or if this association is an artifact of prior study designs, remains unclear.</li></ul><h3 id="What-did-the-researchers-do-and-find"><a href="#What-did-the-researchers-do-and-find" class="headerlink" title="What did the researchers do and find?"></a>What did the researchers do and find?</h3><ul><li>We examined randomly allocated genetic variants associated with height within the Mendelian randomization framework to study the effects of height on risk of atrial fibrillation.</li><li>Genetic variants associated with taller stature were also associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation.

By the time you make it to a top graduate school, almost all your learning has come from people who are smarter and more experienced than you: parents, teachers, bosses. But once you&#x2019;ve finished at Harvard Business School or any other top academic institution, the vast majority of people you&#x2019;ll interact with on a day-to-day basis may not be smarter than you. And if your attitude is that only smarter people have something to teach you, your learning opportunities will be very limited. But if you have a humble eagerness to learn something from everybody, your learning opportunities will be unlimited. Generally, you can be humble only if you feel really good about yourself&#x2014;and you want to help those around you feel really good about themselves, too. When we see people acting in an <strong>abusive</strong> (&#x8FB1;&#x9A82;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x6EE5;&#x7528;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x8650;&#x5F85;&#x7684;), arrogant, or <strong>demeaning</strong> (&#x8D2C;&#x4F4E;) manner toward others, their behavior almost always is a symptom of their lack of self-esteem. They need to put someone else down to feel good about themselves.</p><h2 id="Choose-the-Right-Yardstick-&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;"><a href="#Choose-the-Right-Yardstick-&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;" class="headerlink" title="Choose the Right Yardstick (&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;)"></a>Choose the Right Yardstick (&#x5C3A;&#x5EA6;)</h2><p>This past year I was diagnosed with cancer and faced the possibility that my life would end sooner than I&#x2019;d planned. Thankfully, it now looks as if I&#x2019;ll be <strong>spared</strong> (&#x5E78;&#x514D;,&#x5907;&#x4EFD;&#x7684;). But the experience has given me important insight into my life.</p><p>I have a pretty clear idea of how my ideas have generated enormous revenue for companies that have used my research; I know I&#x2019;ve had a substantial impact. But as I&#x2019;ve confronted this disease, it&#x2019;s been interesting to see how unimportant that impact is to me now. I&#x2019;ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn&#x2019;t dollars but the individual people whose lives I&#x2019;ve touched (&#x53D7;&#x611F;&#x52A8;&#x7684;).</p><p>I think that&#x2019;s the way it will work for us all. Don&#x2019;t worry about the level of individual <strong>prominence</strong> (&#x5353;&#x8D8A;) you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people. This is my final recommendation: Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a <strong>resolution</strong> (&#x51B3;&#x5FC3;,&#x89E3;&#x51B3;) to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

I got a very clear feeling that I shouldn&#x2019;t break my commitment&#x2014;so I didn&#x2019;t play in the championship game.</p><p>In many ways that was a small decision&#x2014;involving one of several thousand Sundays in my life. In theory, surely I could have crossed over the line just that one time and then not done it again. But looking back on it, resisting the <strong>temptation</strong> (&#x5F15;&#x8BF1;&#xFF1B;&#x8BF1;&#x60D1;&#x7269;) whose logic was &#x201C;In this <strong>extenuating</strong> (&#x60C5;&#x6709;&#x53EF;&#x539F;&#x7684;) circumstance, just this once, it&#x2019;s OK&#x201D; has proven to be one of the most important decisions of my life. Why? My life has been one <strong>unending</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x5C3D;&#x7684;) stream of extenuating circumstances. Had I crossed the line that one time, I would have done it over and over in the years that followed.</p><p>The lesson I learned from this is that it&#x2019;s easier to hold to your principles 100% of the time than it is to hold to them 98% of the time. If you give in to &#x201C;just this once,&#x201D; based on a marginal cost analysis, as some of my former classmates have done, you&#x2019;ll regret where you end up. You&#x2019;ve got to define for yourself what you stand for and draw the line in a safe place.</p><h2 id="Remember-the-Importance-of-Humility"><a href="#Remember-the-Importance-of-Humility" class="headerlink" title="Remember the Importance of Humility"></a>Remember the Importance of Humility</h2><p>I got this insight when I was asked to teach a class on humility at Harvard College. I asked all the students to describe the most humble person they knew. One characteristic of these humble people stood out: They had a high level of self-esteem. They knew who they were, and they felt good about who they were. We also decided that humility was defined not by <u>self-deprecating</u> (&#x81EA;&#x8D2C;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x8C26;&#x865A;&#x7684;) behavior or attitudes but by the esteem with which you regard others. Good behavior flows naturally from that kind of humility. For example, you would never steal from someone, because you respect that person too much. You&#x2019;d never lie to someone, either.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

We learn in our course that this <strong>doctrine</strong> (&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;&#xFF1B;&#x5B66;&#x8BF4;&#xFF1B;&#x6559;&#x4E49;) biases companies to leverage what they have put in place to succeed in the past, instead of guiding them to create the capabilities they&#x2019;ll need in the future. If we knew the future would be exactly the same as the past, that approach would be fine. But if the future&#x2019;s different&#x2014;and it almost always is&#x2014;then it&#x2019;s the wrong thing to do.</p><p>This theory addresses the third question I discuss with my students&#x2014;how to live a life of integrity (stay out of jail). Unconsciously, we often employ the marginal cost doctrine in our personal lives when we choose between right and wrong. A voice in our head says, &#x201C;Look, I know that as a general rule, most people shouldn&#x2019;t do this. But in this particular <u>extenuating circumstance,</u> (&#x60C5;&#x6709;&#x53EF;&#x539F;&#x7684;&#x60C5;&#x51B5;) just this once, it&#x2019;s OK.&#x201D; The marginal cost of doing something wrong &#x201C;just this once&#x201D; always seems <strong>alluringly</strong> (&#x8BF1;&#x4EBA;&#x5730;) low. It suckers (&#x5438;) you in, and you don&#x2019;t ever look at where that path ultimately is headed and at the full costs that the choice entails. Justification for <strong>infidelity</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x4FE1;&#x4EF0;) and dishonesty in all their <strong>manifestations</strong> (&#x8868;&#x73B0;) lies in the marginal cost economics of &#x201C;just this once.&#x201D;</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to share a story about how I came to understand the potential damage of &#x201C;just this once&#x201D; in my own life. I played on the Oxford University <strong>varsity</strong> (&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#xFF1B;&#x5927;&#x5B66;&#x8FD0;&#x52A8;&#x4EE3;&#x8868;&#x961F;) basketball team. <u><strong>We worked our tails off</strong> and finished the season undefeated</u> (&#x6211;&#x4EEC;&#x7AED;&#x5C3D;&#x5168;&#x529B;&#xFF0C;&#x5B8C;&#x6210;&#x4E86;&#x4E0D;&#x8D25;&#x7684;&#x8D5B;&#x5B63;). The guys on the team were the best friends I&#x2019;ve ever had in my life. We got to the British <strong>equivalent</strong> (&#x76F8;&#x7B49;&#x7684;) of the NCAA <strong>tournament</strong> (&#x9526;&#x6807;&#x8D5B;&#xFF0C;&#x8054;&#x8D5B;)&#x2014;and made it to the final four. It turned out the championship game was scheduled to be played on a Sunday. I had made a personal commitment to God at age 16 that I would never play ball on Sunday. So I went to the coach and explained my problem. He was <strong>incredulous</strong> (&#x6000;&#x7591;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x96BE;&#x4EE5;&#x7F6E;&#x4FE1;&#x7684;). My teammates were, too, because I was the starting center. Every one of the guys on the team came to me and said, &#x201C;You&#x2019;ve got to play. Can&#x2019;t you break the rule just this one time?&#x201D;</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

When there is little agreement on both axes, you have to use &#x201C;power tools&#x201D;&#x2014;<strong>coercion</strong> (&#x5F3A;&#x5236;&#xFF1B;&#x5F3A;&#x8FEB;), threats, punishment, and so on&#x2014;to secure cooperation. Many companies start in this <strong>quadrant</strong> (&#x8C61;&#x9650;), which is why <u>the founding executive team</u> (&#x521B;&#x59CB;&#x6267;&#x884C;&#x56E2;&#x961F;) must play such an <strong>assertive</strong> (&#x72EC;&#x65AD;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x80AF;&#x5B9A;&#x7684;) role in defining what must be done and how. If employees&#x2019; ways of working together to address those tasks succeed over and over, consensus begins to form. MIT&#x2019;s Edgar Schein has described this process as the mechanism by which a culture is built. Ultimately, people don&#x2019;t even think about whether their way of doing things yields success. They embrace priorities and follow procedures by instinct and assumption rather than by explicit decision&#x2014;which means that they&#x2019;ve created a culture. Culture, in <strong>compelling</strong> (&#x5F15;&#x4EBA;&#x6CE8;&#x76EE;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x4FE1;&#x670D;&#x7684;) but unspoken ways, <strong>dictates</strong> (&#x89C4;&#x5B9A;) the proven (&#x88AB;&#x9A8C;&#x8BC1;&#x7684;), acceptable methods by which members of the group address recurrent problems. And culture defines the priority given to different types of problems. It can be a powerful management tool.</p><p>In using this model to address the question, How can I be sure that my family becomes an enduring source of happiness?, my students quickly see that the simplest tools that parents can wield to elicit cooperation from children are <u>power tools</u> (&#x7535;&#x52A8;&#x5DE5;&#x5177;). But there comes a point during the teen years when power tools no longer work. At that point parents start wishing that they had begun working with their children at a very young age to build a culture at home in which children instinctively behave respectfully toward one another, <strong>obey</strong> (&#x670D;&#x4ECE;) their parents, and choose the right thing to do. Families have cultures, just as companies do. Those cultures can be built consciously or evolve (&#x8FDB;&#x5316;) <strong>inadvertently</strong> (&#x65E0;&#x610F;&#x5730;&#xFF0C;&#x4E0D;&#x7ECF;&#x610F;&#x5730;).</p><p>If you want your kids to have strong self-esteem and confidence that they can solve hard problems, those qualities won&#x2019;t magically materialize in high school. You have to design them into your family&#x2019;s culture&#x2014;and you have to think about this very <strong><u>early on</u></strong> (&#x5728;&#x65E9;&#x671F;). Like employees, children build self-esteem by doing things that are hard and learning what works.</p><p><strong>inadvertently: </strong> &#x65E0;&#x610F;&#x5730;&#xFF0C;&#x4E0D;&#x7ECF;&#x610F;&#x5730; (unconsciousness)</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

And our careers provide the most <strong><u>concrete evidence</u></strong> (&#x786E;&#x51FF;&#x7684;&#x8BC1;&#x636E;&#xFF1B;&#x5177;&#x4F53;&#x7684;&#x8BC1;&#x636E;) that we&#x2019;re moving forward. You ship a product, finish a design, complete a presentation, <u>close a sale</u> (&#x6210;&#x4EA4;), teach a class, publish a paper, get paid, get promoted. In contrast, investing time and energy in your relationship with your spouse and children typically doesn&#x2019;t offer that same immediate sense of achievement. Kids <strong>misbehave</strong> (&#x884C;&#x4E3A;&#x4E0D;&#x7AEF;&#xFF0C;&#x4E3E;&#x6B62;&#x5931;&#x793C;) every day. It&#x2019;s really not until 20 years <u>down the road</u> (&#x5728;&#x8DEF;&#x8FB9;&#xFF1B;&#x4E00;&#x6BB5;&#x65F6;&#x95F4;&#x4E4B;&#x540E;) that you can put your hands on your <strong>hips</strong> (&#x81C0;&#x90E8;) and say, &#x201C;I raised a good son or a good daughter.&#x201D; You can neglect your relationship with your spouse, and on a day-to-day basis, it doesn&#x2019;t seem as if things are <strong>deteriorating</strong> (&#x9000;&#x5316;&#xFF0C;&#x6076;&#x5316;). People who are driven to excel have this unconscious <strong>propensity</strong> (&#x503E;&#x5411;&#xFF0C;&#x4E60;&#x6027;) to underinvest in their families and overinvest in their careers&#x2014;even though intimate and loving relationships with their families are the most powerful and enduring source of happiness.</p><p>If you study the root causes of business disasters, over and over you&#x2019;ll find this predisposition (&#x503E;&#x5411;&#xFF1B;&#x7D20;&#x8D28;&#xFF1B;&#x6613;&#x67D3;&#x75C5;&#x4F53;&#x8D28;) toward endeavors (&#x52AA;&#x529B;) that offer <strong><u>immediate gratification</u></strong> (&#x5373;&#x65F6;&#x6EE1;&#x8DB3;).

I apply the tools of econometrics a few times a year, but I apply my knowledge of the purpose of my life every day. It&#x2019;s the single most useful thing I&#x2019;ve ever learned. <strong><u>I promise my students that if they take the time to figure out their life purpose, they&#x2019;ll look back on it as the most important thing they discovered at HBS</u></strong> (&#x6211;&#x5411;&#x6211;&#x7684;&#x5B66;&#x751F;&#x4EEC;&#x4FDD;&#x8BC1;&#xFF0C;&#x5982;&#x679C;&#x4ED6;&#x4EEC;&#x82B1;&#x65F6;&#x95F4;&#x53BB;&#x601D;&#x8003;&#x81EA;&#x5DF1;&#x7684;&#x4EBA;&#x751F;&#x76EE;&#x6807;&#xFF0C;&#x5F53;&#x4ED6;&#x4EEC;&#x56DE;&#x5934;&#x770B;&#x65F6;&#xFF0C;&#x4F1A;&#x8BA4;&#x4E3A;&#x8FD9;&#x662F;&#x4ED6;&#x4EEC;&#x5728;&#x54C8;&#x4F5B;&#x5546;&#x5B66;&#x9662;&#x53D1;&#x73B0;&#x7684;&#x6700;&#x91CD;&#x8981;&#x7684;&#x4E8B;&#x60C5;&#x3002;).

For example, one of my former students decided that his purpose was to bring honesty and economic prosperity to his country and to raise children who were as <strong>capably</strong> (&#x53C8;&#x80FD;&#x529B;&#x7684;) <u>committed to</u> (&#x81F4;&#x529B;&#xFF0C;&#x4ECE;&#x4E8B;) this <strong>cause</strong> (&#x4E8B;&#x4E1A;&#xFF0C;&#x76EE;&#x6807;), and to each other, as he was. His purpose is focused on family and others&#x2014;as mine is.<br>The choice and successful pursuit of a profession is but one tool for achieving your purpose.

I can guarantee you that not a single one of them graduated with the <strong>deliberate</strong> (&#x6545;&#x610F;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x6DF1;&#x601D;&#x719F;&#x8651;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x4ECE;&#x5BB9;&#x7684;) strategy of getting divorced and raising children who would become <strong>estranged</strong> (&#x758F;&#x8FDC;&#x7684;) from them. And yet a shocking number of them implemented that strategy. The reason? They didn&#x2019;t keep the purpose of their lives front and center as they decided how to spend their time, talents, and energy.</p><p>It&#x2019;s quite startling that a significant fraction of the 900 students that HBS <strong>draws</strong> (&#x5438;&#x5F15;&#xFF0C;&#x62DB;&#x751F;) each year from the world&#x2019;s best have given little thought to the purpose of their lives. I tell the students that HBS might be one of their last chances to reflect deeply on that question. If they think that they&#x2019;ll have more time and energy to reflect later, they&#x2019;re <strong>nuts</strong> (&#x75AF;&#x4E86;&#xFF0C;&#x575A;&#x679C;), because life only gets more demanding: You take on a mortgage; you&#x2019;re working 70 hours a week; you have a spouse and children.</p><p>For me, having a clear purpose in my life has been essential. But it was something I had to think long and hard about before I understood it. When I was a Rhodes scholar, I was in a very <strong>demanding</strong> (&#x82DB;&#x523B;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x8981;&#x6C42;&#x9AD8;&#x7684;) academic program, trying to <strong>cram</strong> (&#x586B;&#x6EE1;&#xFF0C;&#x585E;&#x6EE1;) an extra year&#x2019;s worth of work into my time at Oxford. I decided to spend an hour every night reading, thinking, and <u>praying about</u> (&#x7948;&#x7977;) why God put me on this earth. That was a very challenging commitment to keep, because every hour I spent doing that, I wasn&#x2019;t studying <u>applied econometrics</u> (&#x5E94;&#x7528;&#x8BA1;&#x91CF;&#x7ECF;&#x6D4E;&#x5B66;). I was conflicted about whether I could really afford to take that time away from my studies, but I <u>stuck with</u> (&#x88AB;&#x8FEB;&#x63A5;&#x53D7;&#xFF1B;&#x65E0;&#x6CD5;&#x6446;&#x8131;) it&#x2014;and ultimately figured out the purpose of my life.</p><p><strong>Doing deals (&#x8FBE;&#x6210;&#x4EA4;&#x6613;) doesn&#x2019;t yield the deep rewards that come from building up people.</strong></p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

I tell the students about <u>a vision of sorts</u> (&#x5404;&#x79CD;&#x5404;&#x6837;&#x7684;&#x613F;&#x666F;) I had while I was running the company I founded before becoming an academic. In my mind&#x2019;s eye I saw one of my managers leave for work one morning with a relatively strong level of self-esteem. Then I pictured her driving home to her family 10 hours later, feeling unappreciated, frustrated, underutilized, and <strong>demeaned</strong> (&#x8D2C;&#x4F4E;&#x2026;&#x7684;&#x8EAB;&#x4EFD;&#xFF1B;&#x4F7F;&#x2026;&#x5931;&#x53BB;&#x5C0A;&#x4E25;). I imagined how profoundly her lowered self-esteem affected the way she interacted with her children. The vision in my mind then <strong>fast-forwarded</strong> (&#x5FEB;&#x8FDB;) to another day, when she drove home with greater self-esteem&#x2014;feeling that she had learned a lot, been recognized for achieving valuable things, and played a significant role in the success of some important <strong>initiatives</strong> (&#x4E3E;&#x63AA;&#xFF0C;&#x65B9;&#x6848;). I then imagined how positively that affected her as a spouse and a parent. My conclusion: Management is the most noble of professions if it&#x2019;s practiced well. No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility and be recognized for achievement, and contribute to the success of a team. More and more MBA students come to school thinking that a career in business means buying, selling, and investing in companies. That&#x2019;s unfortunate. Doing deals doesn&#x2019;t yield the deep rewards that come from <u>building up people</u> (&#x57F9;&#x517B;&#x4EBA;).</p><p>I want students to leave my classroom knowing that.</p><h2 id="Create-a-Strategy-for-Your-Life"><a href="#Create-a-Strategy-for-Your-Life" class="headerlink" title="Create a Strategy for Your Life"></a>Create a Strategy for Your Life</h2><p>A theory that is helpful in answering the second question&#x2014;How can I ensure that my relationship with my family proves to be an enduring source of happiness?&#x2014;concerns how strategy is defined and implemented. Its primary insight is that a company&#x2019;s strategy is determined by the types of initiatives that management invests in. If a company&#x2019;s resource allocation process is not managed masterfully, what emerges from it can be very different from what management intended. Because companies&#x2019; decision-making systems are designed to <strong>steer</strong> (&#x63A7;&#x5236;&#xFF0C;&#x5F15;&#x5BFC;&#xFF0C;&#x638C;&#x8235;) investments to initiatives that offer the most tangible and immediate returns, companies <strong>shortchange</strong>  (&#x5C11;&#x652F;&#x4ED8;) investments in initiatives that are crucial to their long-term strategies.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

To that backbone I attach different models or theories that help students think about the various dimensions of a general manager&#x2019;s job in stimulating innovation and growth. In each session we look at one company through the lenses of those theories&#x2014;using them to explain how the company got into its situation and to examine what managerial actions will yield the needed results.</p><p>On the last day of class, I ask my students to turn those theoretical <strong>lenses</strong> (&#x955C;&#x5934;) on themselves, to find <strong>cogent</strong> (&#x6709;&#x8BF4;&#x670D;&#x529B;&#x7684;&#xFF0C;&#x4EE4;&#x4EBA;&#x4FE1;&#x670D;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x6E05;&#x6670;&#x7684;) answers to three questions: First, how can I be sure that I&#x2019;ll be happy in my career? Second, how can I be sure that my relationships with my spouse and my family become an enduring source of happiness? Third, how can I be sure I&#x2019;ll stay out of <strong>jail</strong> (&#x76D1;&#x72F1;&#xFF1B;&#x76D1;&#x7262;)? Though the last question sounds <strong>lighthearted</strong> (&#x8F7B;&#x677E;&#xFF0C;&#x8F7B;&#x5FEB;), it&#x2019;s not. Two of the 32 people in my Rhodes scholar class spent time in jail. Jeff Skilling of Enron fame was a classmate of mine at HBS. These were good guys&#x2014;but something in their lives sent them off in the wrong direction.</p><p>As the students discuss the answers to these questions, I open my own life to them as a case study <u>of sorts</u> (&#x5404;&#x79CD;&#x5404;&#x6837;&#x7684;), to illustrate how they can use the theories from our course to guide their life decisions.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>

He had read one of my early papers about disruptive (&#x7834;&#x574F;&#x7684;&#xFF1B;&#x5206;&#x88C2;&#x6027;&#x7684;) technology, and he asked if I could talk to his <u><strong>direct reports</strong></u> (&#x76F4;&#x63A5;&#x4E0B;&#x5C5E;) and explain my research and what it implied for Intel. Excited, I flew to Silicon Valley and showed up at the appointed time, only to have Grove say, &#x201C;Look, stuff has happened. We have only 10 minutes for you. Tell us what your model of disruption means for Intel.&#x201D; I said that I couldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;that I needed a full 30 minutes to explain the model, because only with it as context would any comments about Intel make sense. Ten minutes into my explanation, Grove interrupted: &#x201C;Look, I&#x2019;ve got your model. Just tell us what it means for Intel.&#x201D;</p><p>I insisted that I needed 10 more minutes to describe how the process of disruption had worked its way through a very different industry, steel, so that he and his team could understand how disruption worked. I told the story of how Nucor and other steel minimills had begun by attacking the lowest end of the market&#x2014;steel reinforcing bars, or <strong>rebar</strong> (&#x94A2;&#x7B4B;)&#x2014;and later moved up toward the high end, undercutting (&#x51FB;&#x8D25;) the traditional steel mills.</p><p>When I finished the minimill story, Grove said, &#x201C;OK, I get it. What it means for Intel is&#x2026;,&#x201D; and then went on to articulate what would become the company&#x2019;s strategy for going to the bottom of the market to launch the Celeron processor.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve thought about that a million times since. If I had <u>been suckered into</u> (&#x88AB;&#x8FF7;&#x60D1;&#x4F4F;&#xFF0C;&#x9677;&#x5165;) telling Andy Grove what he should think about the microprocessor business, I&#x2019;d have been killed. But instead of telling him what to think, I taught him how to think&#x2014;and then he reached what I felt was the correct decision on his own.</p><p>That experience had a profound influence on me. When people ask what I think they should do, I rarely answer their question directly. Instead, I run the question aloud through one of my models. I&#x2019;ll describe how the process in the model worked its way through an industry quite different from their own. And then, more often than not, they&#x2019;ll say, &#x201C;OK, I get it.&#x201D; And they&#x2019;ll answer their own question more insightfully than I could have.</p><hr><p><em>See you tomorrow</em></p>]]></content>
